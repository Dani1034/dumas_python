       "{'XXXII': \"Lorsque Franz revint à lui, les objets extérieurs semblaient une seconde\\npartie de son rêve; il se crut dans un sépulcre où pénétrait à peine,\\ncomme un regard de pitié, un rayon de soleil; il étendit la main et\\nsentit de la pierre; il se mit sur son séant: il était couché dans son\\nburnous, sur un lit de bruyères sèches fort doux et fort odoriférant.\\n\\nToute vision avait disparu, et, comme si les statues n'eussent été que\\ndes ombres sorties de leurs tombeaux pendant son rêve, elles s'étaient\\nenfuies à son réveil.\\n\\nIl fit quelques pas vers le point d'où venait le jour; à toute\\nl'agitation du songe succédait le calme de la réalité. Il se vit dans\\nune grotte, s'avança du côté de l'ouverture, et à travers la porte\\ncintrée aperçut un ciel bleu et une mer d'azur. L'air et l'eau\\nresplendissaient aux rayons du soleil du matin; sur le rivage, les\\nmatelots étaient assis causant et riant; à dix pas en mer la barque se\\nbalançait gracieusement sur son ancre.\\n\\nAlors il savoura quelque temps cette brise fraîche qui lui passait sur\\nle front; il écouta le bruit affaibli de la vague qui se mouvait sur le\\nbord et laissait sur les roches une dentelle d'écume blanche comme de\\nl'argent; il se laissa aller sans réfléchir, sans penser à ce charme\\ndivin qu'il y a dans les choses de la nature, surtout lorsqu'on sort\\nd'un rêve fantastique; puis peu à peu cette vie du dehors, si calme, si\\npure, si grande, lui rappela l'invraisemblance de son sommeil, et les\\nsouvenirs commencèrent à rentrer dans sa mémoire.\\n\\nIl se souvint de son arrivée dans l'île, de sa présentation à un chef de\\ncontrebandiers, d'un palais souterrain plein de splendeurs, d'un souper\\nexcellent et d'une cuillerée de haschich.\\n\\nSeulement, en face de cette réalité de plein jour, il lui semblait qu'il\\ny avait au moins un an que toutes ces choses s'étaient passées, tant le\\nrêve qu'il avait fait était vivant dans sa pensée et prenait\\nd'importance dans son esprit. Aussi de temps en temps son imagination\\nfaisait asseoir au milieu des matelots, ou traverser un rocher, ou se\\nbalancer sur la barque, une de ces ombres qui avaient étoilé sa nuit de\\nleurs baisers. Du reste, il avait la tête parfaitement libre et le corps\\nparfaitement reposé: aucune lourdeur dans le cerveau, mais, au\\ncontraire, un certain bien-être général, une faculté d'absorber l'air et\\nle soleil plus grande que jamais.\\n\\nIl s'approcha donc gaiement de ses matelots.\\n\\nDès qu'ils le revirent ils se levèrent, et le patron s'approcha de lui.\\n\\n«Le seigneur Simbad, lui dit-il, nous a chargés de tous ses compliments\\npour Votre Excellence, et nous a dit de lui exprimer le regret qu'il a\\nde ne pouvoir prendre congé d'elle; mais il espère que vous l'excuserez\\nquand vous saurez qu'une affaire très pressante l'appelle à Malaga.\\n\\n--Ah çà! mon cher Gaetano, dit Franz, tout cela est donc véritablement\\nune réalité: il existe un homme qui m'a reçu dans cette île, qui m'y a\\ndonné une hospitalité royale, et qui est parti pendant mon sommeil?\\n\\n--Il existe si bien, que voilà son petit yacht qui s'éloigne, toutes\\nvoiles dehors, et que, si vous voulez prendre votre lunette d'approche,\\nvous reconnaîtrez selon toute probabilité, votre hôte au milieu de son\\néquipage.»\\n\\nEt, en disant ces paroles, Gaetano étendait le bras dans la direction\\nd'un petit bâtiment qui faisait voile vers la pointe méridionale de la\\nCorse.\\n\\nFranz tira sa lunette, la mit à son point de vue, et la dirigea vers\\nl'endroit indiqué.\\n\\nGaetano ne se trompait pas. Sur l'arrière du bâtiment, le mystérieux\\nétranger se tenait debout tourné de son côté, et tenant comme lui une\\nlunette à la main; il avait en tout point le costume sous lequel il\\nétait apparu la veille à son convive, et agitait son mouchoir en signe\\nd'adieu.\\n\\nFranz lui rendit son salut en tirant à son tour son mouchoir et en\\nl'agitant comme il agitait le sien.\\n\\nAu bout d'une seconde, un léger nuage de fumée se dessina à la poupe du\\nbâtiment, se détacha gracieusement de l'arrière et monta lentement vers\\nle ciel; puis une faible détonation arriva jusqu'à Franz.\\n\\n«Tenez, entendez-vous, dit Gaetano, le voilà qui vous dit adieu!»\\n\\nLe jeune homme prit sa carabine et la déchargea en l'air, mais sans\\nespérance que le bruit pût franchir la distance qui séparait le yacht de\\nla côte.\\n\\n«Qu'ordonne Votre Excellence? dit Gaetano.\\n\\n--D'abord que vous m'allumiez une torche.\\n\\n--Ah! oui, je comprends, reprit le patron, pour chercher l'entrée de\\nl'appartement enchanté. Bien du plaisir, Excellence, si la chose vous\\namuse, et je vais vous donner la torche demandée. Moi aussi, j'ai été\\npossédé de l'idée qui vous tient, et je m'en suis passé la fantaisie\\ntrois ou quatre fois; mais j'ai fini par y renoncer. Giovanni,\\najouta-t-il, allume une torche et apporte-la à Son Excellence.»\\n\\nGiovanni obéit. Franz prit la torche et entra dans le souterrain, suivi\\nde Gaetano.\\n\\nIl reconnut la place où il s'était réveillé à son lit de bruyères encore\\ntout froissé; mais il eut beau promener sa torche sur toute la surface\\nextérieure de la grotte il ne vit rien, si ce n'est, à des traces de\\nfumée, que d'autres avant lui avaient déjà tenté inutilement la même\\ninvestigation.\\n\\nCependant il ne laissa pas un pied de cette muraille granitique,\\nimpénétrable comme l'avenir, sans l'examiner; il ne vit pas une gerçure\\nqu'il n'y introduisît la lame de son couteau de chasse; il ne remarqua\\npas un point saillant qu'il n'appuyât dessus, dans l'espoir qu'il\\ncéderait; mais tout fut inutile, et il perdit, sans aucun résultat, deux\\nheures à cette recherche.\\n\\nAu bout de ce temps, il y renonça; Gaetano était triomphant.\\n\\nQuand Franz revint sur la plage, le yacht n'apparaissait plus que comme\\nun petit point blanc à l'horizon, il eut recours à sa lunette, mais même\\navec l'instrument il était impossible de rien distinguer.\\n\\nGaetano lui rappela qu'il était venu pour chasser des chèvres, ce qu'il\\navait complètement oublié. Il prit son fusil et se mit à parcourir l'île\\nde l'air d'un homme qui accomplit un devoir plutôt qu'il ne prend un\\nplaisir, et au bout d'un quart d'heure il avait tué une chèvre et deux\\nchevreaux. Mais ces chèvres, quoique sauvages et alertes comme des\\nchamois, avaient une trop grande ressemblance avec nos chèvres\\ndomestiques, et Franz ne les regardait pas comme un gibier.\\n\\nPuis des idées bien autrement puissantes préoccupaient son esprit.\\nDepuis la veille il était véritablement le héros d'un conte des _Mille\\net une Nuits_, et invinciblement il était ramené vers la grotte.\\n\\nAlors, malgré l'inutilité de sa première perquisition, il en recommença\\nune seconde, après avoir dit à Gaetano de faire rôtir un des deux\\nchevreaux. Cette seconde visite dura assez longtemps, car lorsqu'il\\nrevint le chevreau était rôti et le déjeuner était prêt.\\n\\nFranz s'assit à l'endroit où la veille, on était venu l'inviter à souper\\nde la part de cet hôte mystérieux, et il aperçut encore comme une\\nmouette bercée au sommet d'une vague, le petit yacht qui continuait de\\ns'avancer vers la Corse.\\n\\n«Mais, dit-il à Gaetano, vous m'avez annoncé que le seigneur Simbad\\nfaisait voile pour Malaga, tandis qu'il me semble à moi qu'il se dirige\\ndirectement vers Porto-Vecchio.\\n\\n--Ne vous rappelez-vous plus, reprit le patron, que parmi les gens de\\nson équipage je vous ai dit qu'il y avait pour le moment deux bandits\\ncorses?\\n\\n--C'est vrai! et il va les jeter sur la côte? dit Franz.\\n\\n--Justement. Ah! c'est un individu, s'écria Gaetano, qui ne craint ni\\nDieu ni diable, à ce qu'on dit, et qui se dérangera de cinquante lieues\\nde sa route pour rendre service à un pauvre homme.\\n\\n--Mais ce genre de service pourrait bien le brouiller avec les autorités\\ndu pays où il exerce ce genre de philanthropie, dit Franz.\\n\\n--Ah! bien, dit Gaetano en riant, qu'est-ce que ça lui fait, à lui, les\\nautorités! il s'en moque pas mal! On n'a qu'à essayer de le poursuivre.\\nD'abord son yacht n'est pas un navire, c'est un oiseau, et il rendrait\\ntrois noeuds sur douze à une frégate; et puis il n'a qu'à se jeter\\nlui-même à la côte, est-ce qu'il ne trouvera pas partout des amis?»\\n\\nCe qu'il y avait de plus clair dans tout cela, c'est que le seigneur\\nSimbad, l'hôte de Franz, avait l'honneur d'être en relation avec les\\ncontrebandiers et les bandits de toutes les côtes de la Méditerranée; ce\\nqui ne laissait pas que d'établir pour lui une position assez étrange.\\n\\nQuant à Franz, rien ne le retenait plus à Monte-Cristo, il avait perdu\\ntout espoir de trouver le secret de la grotte, il se hâta donc de\\ndéjeuner en ordonnant à ses hommes de tenir leur barque prête pour le\\nmoment où il aurait fini.\\n\\nUne demi-heure après, il était à bord.\\n\\nIl jeta un dernier regard sur le yacht; il était prêt à disparaître\\ndans le golfe de Porto-Vecchio.\\n\\nIl donna le signal du départ.\\n\\nAu moment où la barque se mettait en mouvement, le yacht disparaissait.\\nAvec lui s'effaçait la dernière réalité de la nuit précédente: aussi\\nsouper, Simbad, haschich et statues, tout commençait, pour Franz, à se\\nfondre dans le même rêve. La barque marcha toute la journée et toute la\\nnuit; et le lendemain, quand le soleil se leva, c'était l'île de\\nMonte-Cristo qui avait disparu à son tour. Une fois que Franz eut touché\\nla terre, il oublia, momentanément du moins, les événements qui venaient\\nde se passer pour terminer ses affaires de plaisir et de politesse à\\nFlorence, et ne s'occuper que de rejoindre son compagnon, qui\\nl'attendait à Rome.\\n\\nIl partit donc, et le samedi soir il arriva à la place de la Douane par\\nla malle-poste.\\n\\nL'appartement, comme nous l'avons dit, était retenu d'avance, il n'y\\navait donc plus qu'à rejoindre l'hôtel de maître Pastrini; ce qui\\nn'était pas chose très facile, car la foule encombrait les rues, et Rome\\nétait déjà en proie à cette rumeur sourde et fébrile qui précède les\\ngrands événements. Or, à Rome, il y a quatre grands événements par an:\\nle carnaval, la semaine sainte, la Fête-Dieu et la Saint-Pierre.\\n\\nTout le reste de l'année, la ville retombe dans sa morne apathie, état\\nintermédiaire entre la vie et la mort, qui la rend semblable à une\\nespèce de station entre ce monde et l'autre, station sublime, halte\\npleine de poésie et de caractère que Franz avait déjà faite cinq ou six\\nfois, et qu'à chaque fois il avait trouvée plus merveilleuse et plus\\nfantastique encore.\\n\\nEnfin, il traversa cette foule toujours plus grossissante et plus agitée\\net atteignit l'hôtel. Sur sa première demande, il lui fut répondu, avec\\ncette impertinence particulière aux cochers de fiacre retenus et aux\\naubergistes au complet, qu'il n'y avait plus de place pour lui à l'hôtel\\nde Londres. Alors il envoya sa carte à maître Pastrini, et se fit\\nréclamer d'Albert de Morcerf. Le moyen réussi, et maître Pastrini\\naccourut lui-même, s'excusant d'avoir fait attendre Son Excellence,\\ngrondant ses garçons, prenant le bougeoir de la main du cicérone qui\\ns'était déjà emparé du voyageur, et se préparait à le mener près\\nd'Albert, quand celui-ci vint à sa rencontre.\\n\\nL'appartement retenu se composait de deux petites chambres et d'un\\ncabinet. Les deux chambres donnaient sur la rue, circonstance que maître\\nPastrini fit valoir comme y ajoutant un mérite inappréciable. Le reste\\nde l'étage était loué à un personnage fort riche, que l'on croyait\\nSicilien ou Maltais; l'hôtelier ne put pas dire au juste à laquelle des\\ndeux nations appartenait ce voyageur.\\n\\n«C'est fort bien, maître Pastrini, dit Franz, mais il nous faudrait tout\\nde suite un souper quelconque pour ce soir, et une calèche pour demain\\net les jours suivants.\\n\\n--Quant au souper, répondit l'aubergiste, vous allez être servis à\\nl'instant même; mais quant à la calèche....\\n\\n--Comment! quant à la calèche! s'écria Albert. Un instant, un instant!\\nne plaisantons pas, maître Pastrini! il nous faut une calèche.\\n\\n--Monsieur, dit l'aubergiste, on fera tout ce qu'on pourra pour vous en\\navoir une. Voilà tout ce que je puis vous dire.\\n\\n--Et quand aurons-nous la réponse? demanda Franz.\\n\\n--Demain matin, répondit l'aubergiste.\\n\\n--Que diable! dit Albert, on la paiera plus cher, voilà tout: on sait ce\\nque c'est; chez Drake ou Aaron vingt-cinq francs pour les jours\\nordinaires et trente ou trente-cinq francs pour les dimanches et fêtes;\\nmettez cinq francs par jour de courtage, cela fera quarante et n'en\\nparlons plus.\\n\\n--J'ai bien peur que ces messieurs, même en offrant le double, ne\\npuissent pas s'en procurer.\\n\\n--Alors qu'on fasse mettre des chevaux à la mienne; elle est un peu\\nécornée par le voyage, mais n'importe.\\n\\n--On ne trouvera pas de chevaux.»\\n\\nAlbert regarda Franz en homme auquel on fait une réponse qui lui paraît\\nincompréhensible.\\n\\n«Comprenez-vous cela, Franz! pas de chevaux, dit-il; mais des chevaux de\\nposte, ne pourrait-on pas en avoir?\\n\\n--Ils sont tous loués depuis quinze jours, et il ne reste maintenant que\\nceux absolument nécessaires au service.\\n\\n--Que dites-vous de cela? demanda Franz.\\n\\n--Je dis que; lorsqu'une chose passe mon intelligence, j'ai l'habitude\\nde ne pas m'appesantir sur cette chose et de passer à une autre. Le\\nsouper est-il prêt, maître Pastrini?\\n\\n--Oui, Excellence.\\n\\n--Eh bien, soupons d'abord.\\n\\n--Mais la calèche et les chevaux? dit Franz.\\n\\n--Soyez tranquille, cher ami, ils viendront tout seuls; il ne s'agira\\nque d'y mettre le prix.»\\n\\nEt Morcerf, avec cette admirable philosophie qui ne croit rien\\nimpossible tant qu'elle sent sa bourse ronde ou son portefeuille garni,\\nsoupa, se coucha, s'endormit sur les deux oreilles, et rêva qu'il\\ncourait le carnaval dans une calèche à six chevaux.\",\n",
       " 'XXXIII': \"Le lendemain, Franz se réveilla le premier, et aussitôt réveillé, sonna.\\n\\nLe tintement de la clochette vibrait encore, lorsque maître Pastrini\\nentra en personne.\\n\\n«Eh bien, dit l'hôte triomphant, et sans même attendre que Franz\\nl'interrogeât, je m'en doutais bien hier, Excellence, quand je ne\\nvoulais rien vous promettre; vous vous y êtes pris trop tard, et il n'y\\na plus une seule calèche à Rome: pour les trois derniers jours,\\ns'entend.\\n\\n--Oui, reprit Franz, c'est-à-dire pour ceux où elle est absolument\\nnécessaire.\\n\\n--Qu'y a-t-il? demanda Albert en entrant, pas de calèche?\\n\\n--Justement, mon cher ami, répondit Franz, et vous avez deviné du\\npremier coup.\\n\\n--Eh bien, voilà une jolie ville que votre ville éternelle!\\n\\n--C'est-à-dire, Excellence, reprit maître Pastrini, qui désirait\\nmaintenir la capitale du monde chrétien dans une certaine dignité à\\nl'égard de ses voyageurs, c'est-à-dire qu'il n'y a plus de calèche à\\npartir de dimanche matin jusqu'à mardi soir, mais d'ici là vous en\\ntrouverez cinquante si vous voulez.\\n\\n--Ah! c'est déjà quelque chose, dit Albert; nous sommes aujourd'hui\\njeudi; qui sait, d'ici à dimanche, ce qui peut arriver?\\n\\n--Il arrivera dix à douze mille voyageurs, répondit Franz, lesquels\\nrendront la difficulté plus grande encore.\\n\\n--Mon ami, dit Morcerf, jouissons du présent et n'assombrissons pas\\nl'avenir.\\n\\n--Au moins, demanda Franz, nous pourrons avoir une fenêtre?\\n\\n--Sur quoi?\\n\\n--Sur la rue du Cours, parbleu!\\n\\n--Ah! bien oui, une fenêtre! s'exclama maître Pastrini; impossible; de\\ntoute impossibilité! Il en restait une au cinquième étage du palais\\nDoria, et elle a été louée à un prince russe pour vingt sequins par\\njour.»\\n\\nLes deux jeunes gens se regardaient d'un air stupéfait.\\n\\n«Eh bien, mon cher, dit Franz à Albert, savez-vous ce qu'il y a de mieux\\nà faire? c'est de nous en aller passer le carnaval à Venise; au moins\\nlà, si nous ne trouvons pas de voiture, nous trouverons des gondoles.\\n\\n--Ah! ma foi non! s'écria Albert, j'ai décidé que je verrais le\\ncarnaval à Rome, et je l'y verrai, fût-ce sur des échasses.\\n\\n--Tiens! s'écria Franz, c'est une idée triomphante, surtout pour\\néteindre les moccoletti, nous nous déguiserons en polichinelles vampires\\nou en habitants des Landes, et nous aurons un succès fou.\\n\\n--Leurs Excellences désirent-elles toujours une voiture jusqu'à\\ndimanche?\\n\\n--Parbleu! dit Albert, est-ce que vous croyez que nous allons courir les\\nrues de Rome à pied, comme des clercs d'huissier?\\n\\n--Je vais m'empresser d'exécuter les ordres de Leurs Excellences, dit\\nmaître Pastrini: seulement je les préviens que la voiture leur coûtera\\nsix piastres par jour.\\n\\n--Et moi, mon cher monsieur Pastrini, dit Franz, moi qui ne suis pas\\nnotre voisin le millionnaire, je vous préviens à mon tour, qu'attendu\\nque c'est la quatrième fois que je viens à Rome, je sais le prix des\\ncalèches, jours ordinaires, dimanches et fêtes. Nous vous donnerons\\ndouze piastres pour aujourd'hui, demain et après-demain, et vous aurez\\nencore un fort joli bénéfice.\\n\\n--Cependant, Excellence!... dit maître Pastrini, essayant de se\\nrebeller.\\n\\n--Allez, mon cher hôte, allez, dit Franz, ou je vais moi-même faire mon\\nprix avec votre _affettatore_, qui est le mien aussi, c'est un vieil ami\\nà moi, qui m'a déjà pas mal volé d'argent dans sa vie, et qui, dans\\nl'espérance de m'en voler encore, en passera par un prix moindre que\\ncelui que je vous offre: vous perdrez donc la différence et ce sera\\nvotre faute.\\n\\n--Ne prenez pas cette peine, Excellence, dit maître Pastrini, avec ce\\nsourire du spéculateur italien qui s'avoue vaincu, je ferai de mon\\nmieux, et j'espère que vous serez content.\\n\\n--À merveille! voilà ce qui s'appelle parler. Quand voulez-vous la\\nvoiture?\\n\\n--Dans une heure.\\n\\n--Dans une heure elle sera à la porte.»\\n\\nUne heure après, effectivement, la voiture attendait les deux jeunes\\ngens: c'était un modeste fiacre que, vu la solennité de la circonstance,\\non avait élevé au rang de calèche; mais, quelque médiocre apparence\\nqu'il eût, les deux jeunes gens se fussent trouvés bien heureux d'avoir\\nun pareil véhicule pour les trois derniers jours.\\n\\n«Excellence! cria le cicérone en voyant Franz mettre le nez à la\\nfenêtre, faut-il faire approcher le carrosse du palais?»\\n\\nSi habitué que fût Franz à l'emphase italienne, son premier mouvement\\nfut de regarder autour de lui mais c'était bien à lui-même que ces\\nparoles s'adressaient.\\n\\nFranz était l'Excellence; le carrosse, c'était le fiacre; le palais,\\nc'était l'hôtel de Londres.\\n\\nTout le génie laudatif de la nation était dans cette seule phrase.\\n\\nFranz et Albert descendirent. Le carrosse s'approcha du palais. Leurs\\nExcellences allongèrent leurs jambes sur les banquettes, le cicérone\\nsauta sur le siège de derrière.\\n\\n«Où Leurs Excellences veulent-elles qu'on les conduise?\\n\\n--Mais, à Saint-Pierre d'abord, et au Colisée ensuite», dit Albert en\\nvéritable Parisien.\\n\\nMais Albert ne savait pas une chose: c'est qu'il faut un jour pour voir\\nSaint-Pierre, et un mois pour l'étudier: la journée se passa donc rien\\nqu'à voir Saint-Pierre.\\n\\nTout à coup, les deux amis s'aperçurent que le jour baissait.\\n\\nFranz tira sa montre, il était quatre heures et demie.\\n\\nOn reprit aussitôt le chemin de l'hôtel. À la porte, Franz donna l'ordre\\nau cocher de se tenir prêt à huit heures. Il voulait faire voir à Albert\\nle Colisée au clair de lune, comme il lui avait fait voir Saint-Pierre\\nau grand jour. Lorsqu'on fait voir à un ami une ville qu'on a déjà vue,\\non y met la même coquetterie qu'à montrer une femme dont on a été\\nl'amant.\\n\\nEn conséquence, Franz traça au cocher son itinéraire; il devait sortir\\npar la porte del Popolo, longer la muraille extérieure et rentrer par la\\nporte San-Giovanni. Ainsi le Colisée leur apparaissait sans préparation\\naucune, et sans que le Capitole, le Forum, l'arc de Septime Sévère, le\\ntemple d'Antonin et Faustine et la Via Sacra eussent servi de degrés\\nplacés sur sa route pour le rapetisser.\\n\\nOn se mit à table: maître Pastrini avait promis à ses hôtes un festin\\nexcellent; il leur donna un dîner passable: il n'y avait rien à dire.\\n\\nÀ la fin du dîner, il entra lui-même: Franz crut d'abord que c'était\\npour recevoir ses compliments et s'apprêtait à les lui faire, lorsqu'aux\\npremiers mots il l'interrompit:\\n\\n«Excellence, dit-il, je suis flatté de votre approbation; mais ce\\nn'était pas pour cela que j'étais monté chez vous....\\n\\n--Était-ce pour nous dire que vous aviez trouvé une voiture? demanda\\nAlbert en allumant son cigare.\\n\\n--Encore moins, et même, Excellence, vous ferez bien de n'y plus penser\\net d'en prendre votre parti. À Rome, les choses se peuvent ou ne se\\npeuvent pas. Quand on vous a dit qu'elles ne se pouvaient pas, c'est\\nfini.\\n\\n--À Paris, c'est bien plus commode: quand cela ne se peut pas, on paie\\nle double et l'on a à l'instant même ce que l'on demande.\\n\\n--J'entends dire cela à tous les Français, dit maître Pastrini un peu\\npiqué, ce qui fait que je ne comprends pas comment ils voyagent.\\n\\n--Mais aussi, dit Albert en poussant flegmatiquement sa fumée au plafond\\net en se renversant balancé sur les deux pieds de derrière de son\\nfauteuil, ce sont les fous et les niais comme nous qui voyagent; les\\ngens sensés ne quittent pas leur hôtel de la rue du Helder, le boulevard\\nde Gand et le café de Paris.»\\n\\nIl va sans dire qu'Albert demeurait dans la rue susdite, faisait tous\\nles jours sa promenade fashionable, et dînait quotidiennement dans le\\nseul café où l'on dîne, quand toutefois on est en bons termes avec les\\ngarçons.\\n\\nMaître Pastrini resta un instant silencieux, il était évident qu'il\\nméditait la réponse, qui sans doute ne lui paraissait pas parfaitement\\nclaire.\\n\\n«Mais enfin, dit Franz à son tour, interrompant les réflexions\\ngéographiques de son hôte, vous étiez venu dans un but quelconque;\\nvoulez-vous nous exposer l'objet de votre visite?\\n\\n--Ah! c'est juste; le voici: vous avez commandé la calèche pour huit\\nheures?\\n\\n--Parfaitement.\\n\\n--Vous avez l'intention de visiter il Colosseo?\\n\\n--C'est-à-dire le Colisée?\\n\\n--C'est exactement la même chose.\\n\\n--Soit.\\n\\n--Vous avez dit à votre cocher de sortir par la porte del Popolo, de\\nfaire le tour des murs et de rentrer par la porte San-Giovanni?\\n\\n--Ce sont mes propres paroles.\\n\\n--Eh bien, cet itinéraire est impossible.\\n\\n--Impossible!\\n\\n--Ou du moins fort dangereux.\\n\\n--Dangereux! et pourquoi?\\n\\n--À cause du fameux Luigi Vampa.\\n\\n--D'abord, mon cher hôte, qu'est-ce que le fameux Luigi Vampa? demanda\\nAlbert; il peut être très fameux à Rome, mais je vous préviens qu'il est\\nignoré à Paris.\\n\\n--Comment! vous ne le connaissez pas?\\n\\n--Je n'ai pas cet honneur.\\n\\n--Vous n'avez jamais entendu prononcer son nom?\\n\\n--Jamais.\\n\\n--Eh bien, c'est un bandit auprès duquel les Deseraris et les Gasparone\\nsont des espèces d'enfants de choeur.\\n\\n--Attention, Albert! s'écria Franz, voilà donc enfin un bandit!\\n\\n--Je vous préviens, mon cher hôte, que je ne croirai pas un mot de ce\\nque vous allez nous dire. Ce point arrêté entre nous, parlez tant que\\nvous voudrez, je vous écoute. «Il y avait une fois...» Eh bien, allez\\ndonc!»\\n\\nMaître Pastrini se retourna du côté de Franz, qui lui paraissait le plus\\nraisonnable des deux jeunes gens. Il faut rendre justice au brave homme:\\nil avait logé bien des Français dans sa vie, mais jamais il n'avait\\ncompris certain côté de leur esprit.\\n\\n«Excellence, dit-il fort gravement, s'adressant, comme nous l'avons dit,\\nà Franz, si vous me regardez comme un menteur, il est inutile que je\\nvous dise ce que je voulais vous dire; je puis cependant vous affirmer\\nque c'était dans l'intérêt de Vos Excellences.\\n\\n--Albert ne vous dit pas que vous êtes un menteur, mon cher monsieur\\nPastrini, reprit Franz, il vous dit qu'il ne vous croira pas, voilà\\ntout. Mais, moi, je vous croirai, soyez tranquille; parlez donc.\\n\\n--Cependant, Excellence, vous comprenez bien que si l'on met en doute ma\\nvéracité...\\n\\n--Mon cher, reprit Franz, vous êtes plus susceptible que Cassandre, qui\\ncependant était prophétesse, et que personne n'écoutait; tandis que\\nvous, au moins, vous êtes sûr de la moitié de votre auditoire. Voyons,\\nasseyez-vous, et dites-nous ce que c'est que M. Vampa.\\n\\n--Je vous l'ai dit, Excellence, c'est un bandit, comme nous n'en avons\\npas encore vu depuis le fameux Mastrilla.\\n\\n--Eh bien, quel rapport a ce bandit avec l'ordre que j'ai donné à mon\\ncocher de sortir par la porte del Popolo et de rentrer par la porte\\nSan-Giovanni?\\n\\n--Il y a, répondit maître Pastrini, que vous pourrez bien sortir par\\nl'une, mais que je doute que vous rentriez par l'autre.\\n\\n--Pourquoi cela? demanda Franz.\\n\\n--Parce que, la nuit venue, on n'est plus en sûreté à cinquante pas des\\nportes.\\n\\n--D'honneur? s'écria Albert.\\n\\n--Monsieur le vicomte, dit maître Pastrini, toujours blessé jusqu'au\\nfond du coeur du doute émis par Albert sur sa véracité, ce que je dis\\nn'est pas pour vous, c'est pour votre compagnon de voyage, qui connaît\\nRome, lui, et qui sait qu'on ne badine pas avec ces choses-là.\\n\\n--Mon cher, dit Albert s'adressant à Franz, voici une aventure\\nadmirable toute trouvée: nous bourrons notre calèche de pistolets, de\\ntromblons et de fusils à deux coups. Luigi Vampa vient pour nous\\narrêter, nous l'arrêtons. Nous le ramenons à Rome; nous en faisons\\nhommage à Sa Sainteté, qui nous demande ce qu'elle peut faire pour\\nreconnaître un si grand service. Alors nous réclamons purement et\\nsimplement un carrosse et deux chevaux de ses écuries, et nous voyons le\\ncarnaval en voiture; sans compter que probablement le peuple romain,\\nreconnaissant, nous couronne au Capitole et nous proclame, comme Curtius\\net Horatius Coclès, les sauveurs de la patrie.»\\n\\nPendant qu'Albert déduisait cette proposition, maître Pastrini faisait\\nune figure qu'on essayerait vainement de décrire.\\n\\n«Et d'abord, demanda Franz à Albert, où prendrez-vous ces pistolets, ces\\ntromblons, ces fusils à deux coups dont vous voulez farcir votre\\nvoiture?\\n\\n--Le fait est que ce ne sera pas dans mon arsenal, dit-il, car à la\\nTerracine, on m'a pris jusqu'à mon couteau poignard; et à vous?\\n\\n--À moi, on m'en a fait autant à Aqua-Pendente.\\n\\n--Ah çà! mon cher hôte, dit Albert en allumant son second cigare au\\nreste de son premier, savez-vous que c'est très commode pour les voleurs\\ncette mesure-là, et qu'elle m'a tout l'air d'avoir été prise de compte à\\ndemi avec eux?»\\n\\nSans doute maître Pastrini trouva la plaisanterie compromettante, car il\\nn'y répondit qu'à moitié et encore en adressant la parole à Franz, comme\\nau seul être raisonnable avec lequel il pût convenablement s'entendre.\\n\\n«Son Excellence sait que ce n'est pas l'habitude de se défendre quand on\\nest attaqué par des bandits.\\n\\n--Comment! s'écria Albert, dont le courage se révoltait à l'idée de se\\nlaisser dévaliser sans rien dire; comment! ce n'est pas l'habitude?\\n\\n--Non, car toute défense serait inutile. Que voulez-vous faire contre\\nune douzaine de bandits qui sortent d'un fossé, d'une masure ou d'un\\naqueduc, et qui vous couchent en joue tous à la fois?\\n\\n--Eh sacrebleu! je veux me faire tuer!» s'écria Albert.\\n\\nL'aubergiste se tourna vers Franz d'un air qui voulait dire: Décidément,\\nExcellence, votre camarade est fou.\\n\\n«Mon cher Albert, reprit Franz, votre réponse est sublime, et vaut le\\n_Qu'il mourût_ du vieux Corneille: seulement, quand Horace répondait\\ncela, il s'agissait du salut de Rome, et la chose en valait la peine.\\nMais quant à nous, remarquez qu'il s'agit simplement d'un caprice à\\nsatisfaire, et qu'il serait ridicule, pour un caprice, de risquer notre\\nvie.\\n\\n--Ah! _per Bacco_! s'écria maître Pastrini, à la bonne heure, voilà ce\\nqui s'appelle parler.»\\n\\nAlbert se versa un verre de _lacryma Christi_, qu'il but à petits\\ncoups, en grommelant des paroles inintelligibles.\\n\\n«Eh bien, maître Pastrini, reprit Franz, maintenant que voilà mon\\ncompagnon calmé, et que vous avez pu apprécier mes dispositions\\npacifiques, maintenant, voyons qu'est-ce que le seigneur Luigi Vampa?\\nEst-il berger ou patricien? est-il jeune ou vieux? est-il petit ou\\ngrand? Dépeignez-nous le, afin que si nous le rencontrions par hasard\\ndans le monde, comme Jean Sbogar ou Lara, nous puissions au moins le\\nreconnaître.\\n\\n--Vous ne pouvez pas mieux vous adresser qu'à moi, Excellence, pour\\navoir des détails exacts, car j'ai connu Luigi Vampa tout enfant; et, un\\njour que j'étais tombé moi-même entre ses mains, en allant de Ferentino\\nà Alatri, il se souvint, heureusement pour moi, de notre ancienne\\nconnaissance; il me laissa aller, non seulement sans me faire payer de\\nrançon, mais encore après m'avoir fait cadeau d'une fort belle montre et\\nm'avoir raconté son histoire.\\n\\n--Voyons la montre», dit Albert.\\n\\nMaître Pastrini tira de son gousset une magnifique Breguet portant le\\nnom de son auteur, le timbre de Paris et une couronne de comte.\\n\\n«Voilà, dit-il.\\n\\n--Peste! fit Albert, je vous en fais mon compliment; j'ai la pareille à\\npeu près--il tira sa montre de la poche de son gilet--et elle m'a coûté\\ntrois mille francs.\\n\\n--Voyons l'histoire, dit Franz à son tour, en tirant un fauteuil et en\\nfaisant signe à maître Pastrini de s'asseoir.\\n\\n--Leurs Excellences permettent? dit l'hôte.\\n\\n--Pardieu! dit Albert, vous n'êtes pas un prédicateur, mon cher, pour\\nparler debout.»\\n\\nL'hôtelier s'assit, après avoir fait à chacun de ses futurs auditeurs un\\nsalut respectueux, lequel avait pour but d'indiquer qu'il était prêt à\\nleur donner sur Luigi Vampa les renseignements qu'ils demandaient.\\n\\n«Ah çà, fit Franz, arrêtant maître Pastrini au moment où il ouvrait la\\nbouche, vous dites que vous avez connu Luigi Vampa tout enfant; c'est\\ndonc encore un jeune homme?\\n\\n--Comment, un jeune homme! je crois bien; il a vingt-deux ans à peine!\\nOh! c'est un gaillard qui ira loin, soyez tranquille!\\n\\n--Que dites-vous de cela, Albert? c'est beau, à vingt-deux ans, de\\ns'être déjà fait une réputation, dit Franz.\\n\\n--Oui, certes, et, à son âge, Alexandre, César et Napoléon, qui depuis\\nont fait un certain bruit dans le monde, n'étaient pas si avancés que\\nlui.\\n\\n--Ainsi, reprit Franz, s'adressant à son hôte, le héros dont nous allons\\nentendre l'histoire n'a que vingt-deux ans.\\n\\n--À peine, comme j'ai eu l'honneur de vous le dire.\\n\\n--Est-il grand ou petit?\\n\\n--De taille moyenne: à peu près comme Son Excellence, dit l'hôte en\\nmontrant Albert.\\n\\n--Merci de la comparaison, dit celui-ci en s'inclinant.\\n\\n--Allez toujours, maître Pastrini, reprit Franz, souriant de la\\nsusceptibilité de son ami. Et à quelle classe de la société\\nappartenait-il?\\n\\n--C'était un simple petit pâtre attaché à la ferme du comte de\\nSan-Felice, située entre Palestrina et le lac de Gabri. Il était né à\\nPampinara, et était entré à l'âge de cinq ans au service du comte. Son\\npère, berger lui-même à Anagni, avait un petit troupeau à lui; et vivait\\nde la laine de ses moutons et de la récolte faite avec le lait de ses\\nbrebis, qu'il venait vendre à Rome.\\n\\n«Tout enfant, le petit Vampa avait un caractère étrange. Un jour, à\\nl'âge de sept ans, il était venu trouver le curé de Palestrina, et\\nl'avait prié de lui apprendre à lire. C'était chose difficile; car le\\njeune pâtre ne pouvait pas quitter son troupeau. Mais le bon curé allait\\ntous les jours dire la messe dans un pauvre petit bourg trop peu\\nconsidérable pour payer un prêtre, et qui, n'ayant pas même de nom,\\nétait connu sous celui dell'Borgo. Il offrit à Luigi de se trouver sur\\nson chemin à l'heure de son retour et de lui donner ainsi sa leçon, le\\nprévenant que cette leçon serait courte et qu'il eût par conséquent à en\\nprofiter.\\n\\n«L'enfant accepta avec joie.\\n\\n«Tous les jours, Luigi menait paître son troupeau sur la route de\\nPalestrina au Borgo; tous les jours, à neuf heures du matin, le curé\\npassait, le prêtre et l'enfant s'asseyaient sur le revers d'un fossé, et\\nle petit pâtre prenait sa leçon dans le bréviaire du curé.\\n\\n«Au bout de trois mois, il savait lire.\\n\\n«Ce n'était pas tout, il lui fallait maintenant apprendre à écrire.\\n\\n«Le prêtre fit faire par un professeur d'écriture de Rome trois\\nalphabets: un en gros, un en moyen, et un en fin, et il lui montra qu'en\\nsuivant cet alphabet sur une ardoise il pouvait, à l'aide d'une pointe\\nde fer, apprendre à écrire.\\n\\n«Le même soir, lorsque le troupeau fut rentré à la ferme, le petit Vampa\\ncourut chez le serrurier de Palestrina, prit un gros clou, le forgea, le\\nmartela, l'arrondit, et en fit une espèce de stylet antique.\\n\\n«Le lendemain, il avait réuni une provision d'ardoises et se mettait à\\nl'oeuvre.\\n\\n«Au bout de trois mois, il savait écrire.\\n\\n«Le curé, étonné de cette profonde intelligence et touché de cette\\naptitude, lui fit cadeau de plusieurs cahiers de papier, d'un paquet de\\nplumes et d'un canif.\\n\\n«Ce fut une nouvelle étude à faire, mais étude qui n'était rien auprès\\nde la première. Huit jours après, il maniait la plume comme il maniait\\nle stylet.\\n\\n«Le curé raconta cette anecdote au comte de San-Felice, qui voulut voir\\nle petit pâtre, le fit lire et écrire devant lui, ordonna à son\\nintendant de le faire manger avec les domestiques, et lui donna deux\\npiastres par mois.\\n\\n«Avec cet argent, Luigi acheta des livres et des crayons.\\n\\n«En effet, il avait appliqué à tous les objets cette facilité\\nd'imitation qu'il avait, et, comme Giotto enfant, il dessinait sur ses\\nardoises ses brebis, les arbres, les maisons.\\n\\n«Puis, avec la pointe de son canif, il commença à tailler le bois et à\\nlui donner toutes sortes de formes. C'est ainsi que Pinelli, le\\nsculpteur populaire, avait commencé.\\n\\n«Une jeune fille de six ou sept ans, c'est-à-dire un peu plus jeune que\\nVampa, gardait de son côté les brebis dans une ferme voisine de\\nPalestrina; elle était orpheline, née à Valmontone, et s'appelait\\nTeresa.\\n\\n«Les deux enfants se rencontraient, s'asseyaient l'un près de l'autre,\\nlaissaient leurs troupeaux se mêler et paître ensemble, causaient,\\nriaient et jouaient puis, le soir, on démêlait les moutons du comte de\\nSan-Felice d'avec ceux du baron de Cervetri, et les enfants se\\nquittaient pour revenir à leur ferme respective, en se promettant de se\\nretrouver le lendemain matin.\\n\\n«Le lendemain ils tenaient parole, et grandissaient ainsi côte à côte.\\n\\n«Vampa atteignit douze ans, et la petite Teresa onze.\\n\\n«Cependant, leurs instincts naturels se développaient.\\n\\n«À côté du goût des arts que Luigi avait poussé aussi loin qu'il le\\npouvait faire dans l'isolement, il était triste par boutade, ardent par\\nsecousse, colère par caprice, railleur toujours. Aucun des jeunes\\ngarçons de Pampinara, de Palestrina ou de Valmontone n'avait pu non\\nseulement prendre aucune influence sur lui, mais encore devenir son\\ncompagnon. Son tempérament volontaire, toujours disposé à exiger sans\\njamais vouloir se plier à aucune concession, écartait de lui tout\\nmouvement amical, toute démonstration sympathique. Teresa seule\\ncommandait d'un mot, d'un regard, d'un geste à ce caractère entier qui\\npliait sous la main d'une femme, et qui, sous celle de quelque homme que\\nce fût, se serait raidi jusqu'à rompre.\\n\\n«Teresa était, au contraire, vive, alerte et gaie, mais coquette à\\nl'excès, les deux piastres que donnait à Luigi l'intendant du comte de\\nSan-Felice, le prix de tous les petits ouvrages sculptés qu'il vendait\\naux marchands de joujoux de Rome passaient en boucles d'oreilles de\\nperles, en colliers de verre, en aiguilles d'or. Aussi, grâce à cette\\nprodigalité de son jeune ami, Teresa était-elle la plus belle et la plus\\nélégante paysanne des environs de Rome.\\n\\n«Les deux enfants continuèrent à grandir, passant toutes leurs journées\\nensemble, et se livrant sans combat aux instincts de leur nature\\nprimitive. Aussi, dans leurs conversations, dans leurs souhaits, dans\\nleurs rêves, Vampa se voyait toujours capitaine de vaisseau, général\\nd'armée ou gouverneur d'une province; Teresa se voyait riche, vêtue des\\nplus belles robes et suivie de domestiques en livrée, puis, quand ils\\navaient passé toute la journée à broder leur avenir de ces folles et\\nbrillantes arabesques, ils se séparaient pour ramener chacun leurs\\nmoutons dans leur étable, et redescendre, de la hauteur de leurs songes,\\nà l'humilité de leur position réelle.\\n\\n«Un jour, le jeune berger dit à l'intendant du comte qu'il avait vu un\\nloup sortir des montagnes de la Sabine et rôder autour de son troupeau.\\nL'intendant lui donna un fusil: c'est ce que voulait Vampa.\\n\\n«Ce fusil se trouva par hasard être un excellent canon de Brescia,\\nportant la balle comme une carabine anglaise; seulement un jour le\\ncomte, en assommant un renard blessé, en avait cassé la crosse et l'on\\navait jeté le fusil au rebut.\\n\\n«Cela n'était pas une difficulté pour un sculpteur comme Vampa. Il\\nexamina la couche primitive, calcula ce qu'il fallait y changer pour la\\nmettre à son coup d'oeil, et fit une autre crosse chargée d'ornements si\\nmerveilleux que, s'il eût voulu aller vendre à la ville le bois seul, il\\nen eût certainement tiré quinze ou vingt piastres.\\n\\n«Mais il n'avait garde d'agir ainsi: un fusil avait longtemps été le\\nrêve du jeune homme. Dans tous les pays où l'indépendance est substituée\\nà la liberté, le premier besoin qu'éprouve tout coeur fort, toute\\norganisation puissante, est celui d'une arme qui assure en même temps\\nl'attaque et la défense, et qui faisant celui qui la porte terrible, le\\nfait souvent redouté.\\n\\n«À partir de ce moment, Vampa donna tous les instants qui lui restèrent\\nà l'exercice du fusil; il acheta de la poudre et des balles, et tout lui\\ndevint un but: le tronc de l'olivier, triste, chétif et gris, qui pousse\\nau versant des montagnes de la Sabine; le renard qui, le soir, sortait\\nde son terrier pour commencer sa chasse nocturne, et l'aigle qui planait\\ndans l'air. Bientôt il devint si adroit, que Teresa surmontait la\\ncrainte qu'elle avait éprouvée d'abord en entendant la détonation, et\\ns'amusa à voir son jeune compagnon placer la balle de son fusil où il\\nvoulait la mettre, avec autant de justesse que s'il l'eût poussée avec\\nla main.\\n\\n«Un soir, un loup sortit effectivement d'un bois de sapins près duquel\\nles deux jeunes gens avaient l'habitude de demeurer: le loup n'avait pas\\nfait dix pas en plaine qu'il était mort.\\n\\n«Vampa, tout fier de ce beau coup, le chargea sur ses épaules et le\\nrapporta à la ferme.\\n\\n«Tous ces détails donnaient à Luigi une certaine réputation aux\\nalentours de la ferme; l'homme supérieur partout où il se trouve, se\\ncrée une clientèle d'admirateurs. On parlait dans les environs de ce\\njeune pâtre comme du plus adroit, du plus fort et du plus brave\\ncontadino qui fût à dix lieues à la ronde; et quoique de son côté\\nTeresa, dans un cercle plus étendu encore, passât pour une des plus\\njolies filles de la Sabine, personne ne s'avisait de lui dire un mot\\nd'amour, car on la savait aimée par Vampa.\\n\\n«Et cependant les deux jeunes gens ne s'étaient jamais dit qu'ils\\ns'aimaient. Ils avaient poussé l'un à côté de l'autre comme deux arbres\\nqui mêlent leurs racines sous le sol, leurs branches dans l'air, leur\\nparfum dans le ciel; seulement leur désir de se voir était le même; ce\\ndésir était devenu un besoin, et ils comprenaient plutôt la mort qu'une\\nséparation d'un seul jour.\\n\\n«Teresa avait seize ans et Vampa dix-sept.\\n\\n«Vers ces temps, on commença de parler beaucoup d'une bande de brigands\\nqui s'organisait dans les monts Lepini. Le brigandage n'a jamais été\\nsérieusement extirpé dans le voisinage de Rome. Il manque de chefs\\nparfois, mais quand un chef se présente, il est rare qu'il lui manque\\nune bande.\\n\\n«Le célèbre Cucumetto, traqué dans les Abruzzes chassé du royaume de\\nNaples, où il avait soutenu une véritable guerre, avait traversé\\nGarigliano comme Manfred, et était venu entre Sonnino et Juperno se\\nréfugier sur les bords de l'Amasine.\\n\\n«C'était lui qui s'occupait à réorganiser une troupe, et qui marchait\\nsur les traces de Decesaris et de Gasparone, qu'il espérait bientôt\\nsurpasser. Plusieurs jeunes gens de Palestrina, de Frascati et de\\nPampinara disparurent. On s'inquiéta d'eux d'abord puis bientôt on sut\\nqu'ils étaient allés rejoindre la bande de Cucumetto.\\n\\n«Au bout de quelque temps, Cucumetto devint l'objet de l'attention\\ngénérale. On citait de ce chef de bandits des traits d'audace\\nextraordinaires et de brutalité révoltante.\\n\\n«Un jour, il enleva une jeune fille: c'était la fille de l'arpenteur de\\nFrosinone. Les lois des bandits sont positives: une jeune fille est à\\ncelui qui l'enlève d'abord, puis les autres la tirent au sort, et la\\nmalheureuse sert aux plaisirs de toute la troupe jusqu'à ce que les\\nbandits l'abandonnent ou qu'elle meure.\\n\\n«Lorsque les parents sont assez riches pour la racheter, on envoie un\\nmessager qui traite de la rançon; la tête de la prisonnière répond de la\\nsécurité de l'émissaire. Si la rançon est refusée, la prisonnière est\\ncondamnée irrévocablement.\\n\\n«La jeune fille avait son amant dans la troupe de Cucumetto: il\\ns'appelait Carlini.\\n\\n«En reconnaissant le jeune homme, elle tendit les bras vers lui et se\\ncrut sauvée. Mais le pauvre Carlini, en la reconnaissant, lui, sentit\\nson coeur se briser, car il se doutait bien du sort qui attendait sa\\nmaîtresse.\\n\\n«Cependant, comme il était le favori de Cucumetto, comme il avait\\npartagé ses dangers depuis trois ans, comme il lui avait sauvé la vie\\nen abattant d'un coup de pistolet un carabinier qui avait déjà le sabre\\nlevé sur sa tête, il espéra que Cucumetto aurait quelque pitié de lui.\\n\\n«Il prit donc le chef à part, tandis que la jeune fille, assise contre\\nle tronc d'un grand pin qui s'élevait au milieu d'une clairière de la\\nforêt, s'était fait un voile de la coiffure pittoresque des paysannes\\nromaines et cachait son visage aux regards luxurieux des bandits.\\n\\n«Là, il lui raconta tout, ses amours avec la prisonnière, leurs serments\\nde fidélité, et comment chaque nuit, depuis qu'ils étaient dans les\\nenvirons, ils se donnaient rendez-vous dans une ruine.\\n\\n«Ce soir-là justement, Cucumetto avait envoyé Carlini dans un village\\nvoisin, il n'avait pu se trouver au rendez-vous; mais Cucumetto s'y\\nétait trouvé par hasard, disait-il, et c'est alors qu'il avait enlevé la\\njeune fille.\\n\\n«Carlini supplia son chef de faire une exception en sa faveur et de\\nrespecter Rita, lui disant que le père était riche et qu'il payerait une\\nbonne rançon.\\n\\n«Cucumetto parut se rendre aux prières de son ami, et le chargea de\\ntrouver un berger qu'on pût envoyer chez le père de Rita à Frosinone.\\n\\n«Alors Carlini s'approcha tout joyeux de la jeune fille, lui dit qu'elle\\nétait sauvée, et l'invita à écrire à son père une lettre dans laquelle\\nelle racontait ce qui lui était arrivé, et lui annoncerait que sa rançon\\nétait fixée à trois cents piastres.\\n\\n«On donnait pour tout délai au père douze heures, c'est-à-dire jusqu'au\\nlendemain neuf heures du matin.\\n\\n«La lettre écrite, Carlini s'en empara aussitôt et courut dans la plaine\\npour chercher un messager.\\n\\n«Il trouva un jeune pâtre qui parquait son troupeau. Les messagers\\nnaturels des bandits sont les bergers, qui vivent entre la ville et la\\nmontagne, entre la vie sauvage et la vie civilisée.\\n\\n«Le jeune berger partit aussitôt, promettant d'être avant une heure à\\nFrosinone.\\n\\n«Carlini revint tout joyeux pour rejoindre sa maîtresse et lui annoncer\\ncette bonne nouvelle.\\n\\n«Il trouva la troupe dans la clairière, où elle soupait joyeusement des\\nprovisions que les bandits levaient sur les paysans comme un tribut\\nseulement; au milieu de ces gais convives, il chercha vainement\\nCucumetto et Rita.\\n\\n«Il demanda où ils étaient, les bandits répondirent par un grand éclat\\nde rire. Une sueur froide coula sur le front de Carlini, et il sentit\\nl'angoisse qui le prenait aux cheveux.\\n\\n«Il renouvela sa question. Un des convives remplit un verre de vin\\nd'Orvieto et le lui tendit en disant:\\n\\n«--À la santé du brave Cucumetto et de la belle Rita!\\n\\n«En ce moment, Carlini crut entendre un cri de femme. Il devina tout. Il\\nprit le verre, le brisa sur la face de celui qui le lui présentait, et\\ns'élança dans la direction du cri.\\n\\n«Au bout de cent pas, au détour d'un buisson, il trouva Rita évanouie\\nentre les bras de Cucumetto.\\n\\n«En apercevant Carlini, Cucumetto se releva tenant un pistolet de chaque\\nmain.\\n\\n«Les deux bandits se regardèrent un instant: l'un le sourire de la\\nluxure sur les lèvres, l'autre la pâleur de la mort sur le front.\\n\\n«On eût cru qu'il allait se passer entre ces deux hommes quelque chose\\nde terrible. Mais peu à peu les traits de Carlini se détendirent, sa\\nmain, qu'il avait portée à un des pistolets de sa ceinture, retomba près\\nde lui pendante à son côté.\\n\\n«Rita était couchée entre eux deux.\\n\\n«La lune éclairait cette scène.\\n\\n«--Eh bien, lui dit Cucumetto, as-tu fait la commission dont tu t'étais\\nchargé?\\n\\n«--Oui, capitaine, répondit Carlini, et demain, avant neuf heures, le\\npère de Rita sera ici avec l'argent.\\n\\n«--À merveille. En attendant, nous allons passer une joyeuse nuit. Cette\\njeune fille est charmante, et tu as, en vérité, bon goût, maître\\nCarlini. Aussi comme je ne suis pas égoïste nous allons retourner auprès\\ndes camarades et tirer au sort à qui elle appartiendra maintenant.\\n\\n«--Ainsi vous êtes décidé à l'abandonner à la loi commune? demanda\\nCarlini.\\n\\n«--Et pourquoi ferait-on exception en sa faveur?\\n\\n«--J'avais cru qu'à ma prière....\\n\\n«--Et qu'es-tu plus que les autres?\\n\\n«--C'est juste.\\n\\n«--Mais sois tranquille, reprit Cucumetto en riant, un peu plus tôt, un\\npeu plus tard, ton tour viendra.\\n\\n«Les dents de Carlini se serraient à se briser.\\n\\n«--Allons, dit Cucumetto en faisant un pas vers les convives, viens-tu?\\n\\n«--Je vous suis....\\n\\n«Cucumetto s'éloigna sans perdre de vue Carlini, car sans doute il\\ncraignait qu'il ne le frappât par derrière. Mais rien dans le bandit ne\\ndénonçait une intention hostile.\\n\\n«Il était debout, les bras croisés, près de Rita toujours évanouie.\\n\\n«Un instant, l'idée de Cucumetto fut que le jeune homme allait la\\nprendre dans ses bras et fuir avec elle. Mais peu lui importait\\nmaintenant, il avait eu de Rita ce qu'il voulait; et quant à l'argent,\\ntrois cents piastres réparties à la troupe faisaient une si pauvre somme\\nqu'il s'en souciait médiocrement.\\n\\n«Il continua donc sa route vers la clairière; mais, à son grand\\nétonnement, Carlini y arriva presque aussitôt que lui.\\n\\n«--Le tirage au sort! le tirage au sort! crièrent tous les bandits en\\napercevant le chef.\\n\\n«Et les yeux de tous ces hommes brillèrent d'ivresse et de lascivité,\\ntandis que la flamme du foyer jetait sur toute leur personne une lueur\\nrougeâtre qui les faisait ressembler à des démons.\\n\\n«Ce qu'ils demandaient était juste; aussi le chef fit-il de la tête un\\nsigne annonçant qu'il acquiesçait à leur demande. On mit tous les noms\\ndans un chapeau, celui de Carlini comme ceux des autres, et le plus\\njeune de la bande tira de l'urne improvisée un bulletin.\\n\\n«Ce bulletin portait le nom de Diavolaccio.\\n\\n«C'était celui-là même qui avait proposé à Carlini la santé du chef, et\\nà qui Carlini avait répondu en lui brisant le verre sur la figure.\\n\\n«Une large blessure ouverte de la tempe à la bouche, laissait couler le\\nsang à flots.\\n\\n«Diavolaccio, se voyant ainsi favorisé de la fortune, poussa un éclat de\\nrire.\\n\\n«--Capitaine, dit-il, tout à l'heure Carlini n'a pas voulu boire à votre\\nsanté, proposez-lui de boire à la mienne; il aura peut-être plus de\\ncondescendance pour vous que pour moi.»\\n\\n«Chacun s'attendait à une explosion de la part de Carlini; mais au grand\\nétonnement de tous, il prit un verre d'une main, un fiasco de l'autre,\\npuis, remplissant le verre:\\n\\n«--À ta santé, Diavolaccio, dit-il d'une voix parfaitement calme.\\n\\n«Et il avala le contenu du verre sans que sa main tremblât. Puis,\\ns'asseyant près du feu:\\n\\n«--Ma part de souper! dit-il; la course que je viens de faire m'a donné\\nde l'appétit.\\n\\n«--Vive Carlini! s'écrièrent les brigands.\\n\\n«--À la bonne heure, voilà ce qui s'appelle prendre la chose en bon\\ncompagnon.\\n\\n«Et tous reformèrent le cercle autour du foyer, tandis que Diavolaccio\\ns'éloignait.\\n\\n«Carlini mangeait et buvait, comme si rien ne s'était passé.\\n\\n«Les bandits le regardaient avec étonnement, ne comprenant rien à cette\\nimpassibilité, lorsqu'ils entendirent derrière eux retentir sur le sol\\nun pas alourdi.\\n\\n«Ils se retournèrent et aperçurent Diavolaccio tenant la jeune fille\\nentre ses bras.\\n\\n«Elle avait la tête renversée, et ses longs cheveux pendaient jusqu'à\\nterre.\\n\\n«À mesure qu'ils entraient dans le cercle de la lumière projetée par le\\nfoyer, on s'apercevait de la pâleur de la jeune fille et de la pâleur du\\nbandit.\\n\\n«Cette apparition avait quelque chose de si étrange et de si solennel,\\nque chacun se leva, excepté Carlini, qui resta assis et continua de\\nboire et de manger, comme si rien ne se passait autour de lui.\\n\\n«Diavolaccio continuait de s'avancer au milieu du plus profond silence,\\net déposa Rita aux pieds du capitaine.\\n\\n«Alors tout le monde put reconnaître la cause de cette pâleur de la\\njeune fille et de cette pâleur du bandit: Rita avait un couteau enfoncé\\njusqu'au manche au-dessous de la mamelle gauche.\\n\\n«Tous les yeux se portèrent sur Carlini: la gaine était vide à sa\\nceinture.\\n\\n«--Ah! ah! dit le chef, je comprends maintenant pourquoi Carlini était\\nresté en arrière.\\n\\n«Toute nature sauvage est apte à apprécier une action forte; quoique\\npeut-être aucun des bandits n'eût fait ce que venait de faire Carlini,\\ntous comprirent ce qu'il avait fait.\\n\\n«--Eh bien, dit Carlini en se levant à son tour et en s'approchant du\\ncadavre, la main sur la crosse d'un de ses pistolets, y a-t-il encore\\nquelqu'un qui me dispute cette femme?\\n\\n«--Non, dit le chef, elle est à toi!»\\n\\n«Alors Carlini la prit à son tour dans ses bras, et l'emporta hors du\\ncercle de lumière que projetait la flamme du foyer.\\n\\n«Cucumetto disposa les sentinelles comme d'habitude, et les bandits se\\ncouchèrent, enveloppés dans leurs manteaux, autour du foyer.\\n\\n«À minuit, la sentinelle donna l'éveil, et en un instant le chef et ses\\ncompagnons furent sur pied.\\n\\n«C'était le père de Rita, qui arrivait lui-même, portant la rançon de sa\\nfille.\\n\\n«--Tiens, dit-il à Cucumetto en lui tendant un sac d'argent, voici trois\\ncents pistoles, rends-moi mon enfant.\\n\\n«Mais le chef, sans prendre l'argent, lui fit signe de le suivre. Le\\nvieillard obéit; tous deux s'éloignèrent sous les arbres, à travers les\\nbranches desquels filtraient les rayons de la lune. Enfin Cucumetto\\ns'arrêta étendant la main et montrant au vieillard deux personnes\\ngroupées au pied d'un arbre:\\n\\n«--Tiens, lui dit-il, demande ta fille à Carlini, c'est lui qui t'en\\nrendra compte.\\n\\n«Et il s'en retourna vers ses compagnons.\\n\\n«Le vieillard resta immobile et les yeux fixes. Il sentait que quelque\\nmalheur inconnu, immense, inouï, planait sur sa tête.\\n\\n«Enfin, il fit quelques pas vers le groupe informe dont il ne pouvait se\\nrendre compte.\\n\\n«Au bruit qu'il faisait en s'avançant vers lui, Carlini releva la tête,\\net les formes des deux personnages commencèrent à apparaître plus\\ndistinctes aux yeux du vieillard.\\n\\n«Une femme était couchée à terre, la tête posée sur les genoux d'un\\nhomme assis et qui se tenait penché vers elle; c'était en se relevant\\nque cet homme avait découvert le visage de la femme qu'il tenait serrée\\ncontre sa poitrine.\\n\\n«Le vieillard reconnut sa fille, et Carlini reconnut le vieillard.\\n\\n«--Je t'attendais, dit le bandit au père de Rita.\\n\\n«--Misérable! dit le vieillard, qu'as-tu fait?\\n\\n«Et il regardait avec terreur Rita, pâle, immobile, ensanglantée, avec\\nun couteau dans la poitrine.\\n\\n«Un rayon de la lune frappait sur elle et l'éclairait de sa lueur\\nblafarde.\\n\\n«--Cucumetto avait violé ta fille, dit le bandit, et, comme je l'aimais,\\nje l'ai tuée; car, après lui, elle allait servir de jouet à toute la\\nbande.\\n\\n«Le vieillard ne prononça point une parole, seulement il devint pâle\\ncomme un spectre.\\n\\n«--Maintenant, dit Carlini, si j'ai eu tort, venge-la.\\n\\n«Et il arracha le couteau du sein de la jeune fille et, se levant, il\\nl'alla offrir d'une main au vieillard tandis que de l'autre il écartait\\nsa veste et lui présentait sa poitrine nue.\\n\\n«--Tu as bien fait, lui dit le vieillard d'une voix sourde.\\nEmbrasse-moi, mon fils.\\n\\n«Carlini se jeta en sanglotant dans les bras du père de sa maîtresse.\\nC'étaient les premières larmes que versait cet homme de sang.\\n\\n«--Maintenant, dit le vieillard à Carlini, aide-moi à enterrer ma fille.\\n\\n«Carlini alla chercher deux pioches, et le père et l'amant se mirent à\\ncreuser la terre au pied d'un chêne dont les branches touffues devaient\\nrecouvrir la tombe de la jeune fille.\\n\\n«Quand la tombe fut creusée, le père l'embrassa le premier, l'amant\\nensuite; puis, l'un la prenant par les pieds, l'autre par-dessous les\\népaules, ils la descendirent dans la fosse.\\n\\n«Puis ils s'agenouillèrent des deux côtés et dirent les prières des\\nmorts.\\n\\n«Puis, lorsqu'ils eurent fini, ils repoussèrent la terre sur le cadavre\\njusqu'à ce que la fosse fût comblée.\\n\\n«Alors, lui tendant la main:\\n\\n«--Je te remercie, mon fils! dit le vieillard à Carlini; maintenant,\\nlaisse-moi seul.\\n\\n«--Mais cependant... dit celui-ci.\\n\\n«--Laisse-moi, je te l'ordonne.\\n\\n«Carlini obéit, alla rejoindre ses camarades, s'enveloppa dans son\\nmanteau, et bientôt parut aussi profondément endormi que les autres.\\n\\n«Il avait été décidé la veille que l'on changerait de campement.\\n\\n«Une heure avant le jour Cucumetto éveilla ses hommes et l'ordre fut\\ndonné de partir.\\n\\n«Mais Carlini ne voulut pas quitter la forêt sans savoir ce qu'était\\ndevenu le père de Rita.\\n\\n«Il se dirigea vers l'endroit où il l'avait laissé.\\n\\n«Il trouva le vieillard pendu à une des branches du chêne qui ombrageait\\nla tombe de sa fille.\\n\\n«Il fit alors sur le cadavre de l'un et sur la fosse de l'autre le\\nserment de les venger tous deux.\\n\\n«Mais il ne put tenir ce serment; car, deux jours après dans une\\nrencontre avec les carabiniers romains, Carlini fut tué.\\n\\n«Seulement, on s'étonna que, faisant face à l'ennemi, il eût reçu une\\nballe entre les deux épaules.\\n\\n«L'étonnement cessa quand un des bandits eut fait remarquer à ses\\ncamarades que Cucumetto était placé dix pas en arrière de Carlini\\nlorsque Carlini était tombé.\\n\\n«Le matin du départ de la forêt de Frosinone, il avait suivi Carlini\\ndans l'obscurité, avait entendu le serment qu'il avait fait, et, en\\nhomme de précaution, il avait pris l'avance.\\n\\n«On racontait encore sur ce terrible chef de bande dix autres histoires\\nnon moins curieuses que celle-ci.\\n\\n«Ainsi, de Fondi à Pérouse, tout le monde tremblait au seul nom de\\nCucumetto.\\n\\n«Ces histoires avaient souvent été l'objet des conversations de Luigi et\\nde Teresa.\\n\\n«La jeune fille tremblait fort à tous ces récits; mais Vampa la\\nrassurait avec un sourire, frappant son bon fusil, qui portait si bien\\nla balle; puis, si elle n'était pas rassurée, il lui montrait à cent pas\\nquelque corbeau perché sur une branche morte, le mettait en joue,\\nlâchait la détente, et l'animal, frappé, tombait au pied de l'arbre.\\n\\n«Néanmoins, le temps s'écoulait: les deux jeunes gens avaient arrêté\\nqu'ils se marieraient lorsqu'ils auraient, Vampa vingt ans, et Teresa\\ndix-neuf.\\n\\n«Ils étaient orphelins tous deux; ils n'avaient de permission à demander\\nqu'à leur maître; ils l'avaient demandée et obtenue.\\n\\n«Un jour qu'ils causaient de leur projet d'avenir, ils entendirent deux\\nou trois coups de feu; puis tout à coup un homme sortit du bois près\\nduquel les deux jeunes gens avaient l'habitude de faire paître leurs\\ntroupeaux, et accourut vers eux.\\n\\n«Arrivé à la portée de la voix:\\n\\n«--Je suis poursuivi! leur cria-t-il; pouvez-vous me cacher?\\n\\n«Les deux jeunes gens reconnurent bien que ce fugitif devait être\\nquelque bandit; mais il y a entre le paysan et le bandit romain une\\nsympathie innée qui fait que le premier est toujours prêt à rendre\\nservice au second.\\n\\n«Vampa, sans rien dire, courut donc à la pierre qui bouchait l'entrée de\\nleur grotte, démasqua cette entrée en tirant la pierre à lui, fit signe\\nau fugitif de se réfugier dans cet asile inconnu de tous, repoussa la\\npierre sur lui et revint s'asseoir près de Teresa.\\n\\n«Presque aussitôt, quatre carabiniers à cheval apparurent à la lisière\\ndu bois; trois paraissaient être à la recherche du fugitif, le quatrième\\ntraînait par le cou un bandit prisonnier.\\n\\n«Les trois carabiniers explorèrent le pays d'un coup d'oeil, aperçurent\\nles deux jeunes gens, accoururent à eux au galop, et les interrogèrent.\\n\\n«Ils n'avaient rien vu.\\n\\n«--C'est fâcheux, dit le brigadier, car celui que nous cherchons, c'est\\nle chef.\\n\\n«--Cucumetto? ne purent s'empêcher de s'écrier ensemble Luigi et Teresa.\\n\\n«--Oui, répondit le brigadier; et comme sa tête est mise à prix à mille\\nécus romains, il y en aurait eu cinq cents pour vous si vous nous aviez\\naidés à le prendre.\\n\\n«Les deux jeunes gens échangèrent un regard. Le brigadier eut un instant\\nd'espérance. Cinq cents écus romains font trois mille francs, et trois\\nmille francs sont une fortune pour deux pauvres orphelins qui vont se\\nmarier.\\n\\n«--Oui, c'est fâcheux, dit Vampa, mais nous ne l'avons pas vu.\\n\\n«Alors les carabiniers battirent le pays dans des directions\\ndifférentes, mais inutilement.\\n\\n«Puis, successivement, ils disparurent.\\n\\n«Alors Vampa alla tirer la pierre, et Cucumetto sortit.\\n\\n«Il avait vu, à travers les jours de la porte de granit, les deux jeunes\\ngens causer avec les carabiniers; il s'était douté du sujet de leur\\nconversation, il avait lu sur le visage de Luigi et de Teresa\\nl'inébranlable résolution de ne point le livrer et tira de sa poche une\\nbourse pleine d'or et la leur offrit.\\n\\n«Mais Vampa releva la tête avec fierté; quant à Teresa, ses yeux\\nbrillèrent en pensant à tout ce qu'elle pourrait acheter de riches\\nbijoux et beaux habits avec cette bourse pleine d'or.\\n\\n«Cucumetto était un Satan fort habile: il avait pris la forme d'un\\nbandit au lieu de celle d'un serpent; il surprit ce regard, reconnut\\ndans Teresa une digne fille d'Ève, et rentra dans la forêt en se\\nretournant plusieurs fois sous prétexte de saluer ses libérateurs.\\n\\n«Plusieurs jours s'écoulèrent sans que l'on revit Cucumetto, sans qu'on\\nentendit reparler de lui.\\n\\n«Le temps du carnaval approchait. Le comte de San-Felice annonça un\\ngrand bal masqué où tout ce que Rome avait de plus élégant fut invité.\\n\\n«Teresa avait grande envie de voir ce bal. Luigi demanda à son\\nprotecteur l'intendant la permission pour elle et pour lui d'y assister\\ncachés parmi les serviteurs de la maison. Cette permission lui fut\\naccordée.\\n\\n«Ce bal était surtout donné par le comte pour faire plaisir à sa fille\\nCarmela, qu'il adorait.\\n\\n«Carmela était juste de l'âge et de la taille de Teresa, et Teresa était\\nau moins aussi belle que Carmela.\\n\\n«Le soir du bal, Teresa mit sa plus belle toilette, ses plus riches\\naiguilles, ses plus brillantes verroteries. Elle avait le costume des\\nfemmes de Frascati.\\n\\n«Luigi avait l'habit si pittoresque du paysan romain les jours de fête.\\n\\n«Tous deux se mêlèrent, comme on l'avait permis, aux serviteurs et aux\\npaysans.\\n\\n«La fête était magnifique. Non seulement la villa était ardemment\\nilluminée, mais des milliers de lanternes de couleur étaient suspendues\\naux arbres du jardin. Aussi bientôt le palais eut-il débordé sur les\\nterrasses et les terrasses dans les allées.\\n\\n«À chaque carrefour il y avait un orchestre, des buffets et des\\nrafraîchissements; les promeneurs s'arrêtaient, les quadrilles se\\nformaient et l'on dansait là où il plaisait de danser.\\n\\n«Carmela était vêtue en femme de Sonino. Elle avait son bonnet tout\\nbrodé de perles, les aiguilles de ses cheveux étaient d'or et de\\ndiamants, sa ceinture était de soie turque à grandes fleurs brochées,\\nson surtout et son jupon étaient de cachemire, son tablier était de\\nmousseline des Indes; les boutons de son corset étaient autant de\\npierreries.\\n\\n«Deux autres de ses compagnes étaient vêtues, l'une en femme de Nettuno,\\nl'autre en femme de la Riccia.\\n\\n«Quatre jeunes gens des plus riches et des plus nobles familles de Rome\\nles accompagnaient avec cette liberté italienne qui a son égale dans\\naucun autre pays du monde: ils étaient vêtus de leur côté en paysans\\nd'Albano, de Velletri, de Civita-Castellana et de Sora.\\n\\n«Il va sans dire que ces costumes de paysans, comme ceux de paysannes,\\nétaient resplendissant d'or et de pierreries.\\n\\n«Il vint à Carmela l'idée de faire un quadrille uniforme, seulement il\\nmanquait une femme.\\n\\n«Carmela regardait tout autour d'elle, pas une de ses invitées n'avait\\nun costume analogue au sien et à ceux de ses compagnes.\\n\\n«Le comte San-Felice lui montra, au milieu des paysannes, Teresa appuyée\\nau bras de Luigi.\\n\\n«--Est-ce que vous permettez, mon père? dit Carmela.\\n\\n«--Sans doute, répondit le comte, ne sommes-nous pas en carnaval!\\n\\n«Carmela se pencha vers un jeune homme qui l'accompagnait en causant, et\\nlui dit quelques mots tout en lui montrant du doigt la jeune fille.\\n\\n«Le jeune homme suivit des yeux la jolie main qui lui servait de\\nconductrice, fit un geste d'obéissance et vint inviter Teresa à figurer\\nau quadrille dirigé par la fille du comte.\\n\\n«Teresa sentit comme une flamme qui lui passait sur le visage. Elle\\ninterrogea du regard Luigi: il n'y avait pas moyen de refuser. Luigi\\nlaissa lentement glisser le bras de Teresa, qu'il tenait sous le sien,\\net Teresa, s'éloignant conduite par son élégant cavalier, vint prendre,\\ntoute tremblante, sa place au quadrille aristocratique.\\n\\n«Certes, aux yeux d'un artiste, l'exact et sévère costume de Teresa eût\\neu un bien autre caractère que celui de Carmela et des ses compagnes,\\nmais Teresa était une jeune fille frivole et coquette; les broderies de\\nla mousseline, les palmes de la ceinture, l'éclat du cachemire\\nl'éblouissaient, le reflet des saphirs et des diamants la rendaient\\nfolle.\\n\\n«De son côté Luigi sentait naître en lui un sentiment inconnu: c'était\\ncomme une douleur sourde qui le mordait au coeur d'abord, et de là,\\ntoute frémissante, courait par ses veines et s'emparait de tout son\\ncorps; il suivit des yeux les moindres mouvements de Teresa et de son\\ncavalier; lorsque leurs mains se touchaient il ressentait comme des\\néblouissements, ses artères battaient avec violence, et l'on eût dit\\nque le son d'une cloche vibrait à ses oreilles. Lorsqu'ils se parlaient,\\nquoique Teresa écoutât, timide et les yeux baissés, les discours de son\\ncavalier, comme Luigi lisait dans les yeux ardents du beau jeune homme\\nque ces discours étaient des louanges, il lui semblait que la terre\\ntournait sous lui et que toutes les voix de l'enfer lui soufflaient des\\nidées de meurtre et d'assassinat. Alors, craignant de se laisser\\nemporter à sa folie, il se cramponnait d'une main à la charmille contre\\nlaquelle il était debout, et de l'autre il serrait d'un mouvement\\nconvulsif le poignard au manche sculpté qui était passé dans sa ceinture\\net que, sans s'en apercevoir, il tirait quelquefois presque entier du\\nfourreau.\\n\\n«Luigi était jaloux! il sentait qu'emportée par sa nature coquette et\\norgueilleuse Teresa pouvait lui échapper.\\n\\n«Et cependant la jeune paysanne, timide et presque effrayée d'abord,\\ns'était bientôt remise. Nous avons dit que Teresa était belle. Ce n'est\\npas tout, Teresa était gracieuse, de cette grâce sauvage bien autrement\\npuissante que notre grâce minaudière et affectée.\\n\\n«Elle eut presque les honneurs du quadrille, et si elle fut envieuse de\\nla fille du comte de San-Felice, nous n'oserions pas dire que Carmela ne\\nfut pas jalouse d'elle.\\n\\n«Aussi fût-ce avec force compliments que son beau cavalier la\\nreconduisit à la place où il l'avait prise, et où l'attendait Luigi.\\n\\n«Deux ou trois fois, pendant la contredanse, la jeune fille avait jeté\\nun regard sur lui, et à chaque fois elle l'avait vu pâle et les traits\\ncrispés. Une fois même la lame de son couteau, à moitié tirée de sa\\ngaine, avait ébloui ses yeux comme un sinistre éclair.\\n\\n«Ce fut donc presque en tremblant qu'elle reprit le bras de son amant.\\n\\n«Le quadrille avait eu le plus grand succès, et il était évident qu'il\\nétait question d'en faire une seconde édition; Carmela seule s'y\\nopposait; mais le comte de San-Felice pria sa fille si tendrement,\\nqu'elle finit par consentir.\\n\\n«Aussitôt un des cavaliers s'avança pour inviter Teresa, sans laquelle\\nil était impossible que la contredanse eût lieu; mais la jeune fille\\navait déjà disparu.\\n\\n«En effet, Luigi ne s'était pas senti la force de supporter une seconde\\népreuve; et, moitié par persuasion, moitié par force, il avait entraîné\\nTeresa vers un autre point du jardin. Teresa avait cédé bien malgré\\nelle; mais elle avait vu à la figure bouleversée du jeune homme, elle\\ncomprenait à son silence entrecoupé de tressaillements nerveux, que\\nquelque chose d'étrange se passait en lui. Elle-même n'était pas exempte\\nd'une agitation intérieure, et sans avoir cependant rien fait de mal,\\nelle comprenait que Luigi était en droit de lui faire des reproches: sur\\nquoi? elle l'ignorait; mais elle ne sentait pas moins que ces reproches\\nseraient mérités.\\n\\n«Cependant, au grand étonnement de Teresa, Luigi demeura muet, et pas\\nune parole n'entrouvrit ses lèvres pendant tout le reste de la soirée.\\nSeulement, lorsque le froid de la nuit eut chassé les invités des\\njardins et que les portes de la villa se furent refermées sur eux pour\\nune fête intérieure, il reconduisit Teresa; puis, comme elle allait\\nrentrer chez elle:\\n\\n«--Teresa, dit-il, à quoi pensais-tu lorsque tu dansais en face de la\\njeune comtesse de San-Felice?\\n\\n«--Je pensais, répondit la jeune fille dans toute la franchise de son\\nâme, que je donnerais la moitié de ma vie pour avoir un costume comme\\ncelui qu'elle portait.\\n\\n«--Et que te disait ton cavalier?\\n\\n«--Il me disait qu'il ne tiendrait qu'à moi de l'avoir, et que je\\nn'avais qu'un mot à dire pour cela.\\n\\n«--Il avait raison, répondit Luigi. Le désires-tu aussi ardemment que tu\\nle dis?\\n\\n«--Oui.\\n\\n«--Eh bien tu l'auras!\\n\\n«La jeune fille, étonnée, leva la tête pour le questionner; mais son\\nvisage était si sombre et si terrible que la parole se glaça sur ses\\nlèvres.\\n\\n«D'ailleurs, en disant ces paroles, Luigi s'était éloigné.\\n\\n«Teresa le suivit des yeux dans la nuit tant qu'elle put l'apercevoir.\\nPuis, lorsqu'il eut disparu, elle rentra chez elle en soupirant.\\n\\n«Cette même nuit, il arriva un grand événement par l'imprudence sans\\ndoute de quelque domestique qui avait négligé d'éteindre les lumières;\\nle feu prit à la villa San-Felice, juste dans les dépendances de\\nl'appartement de la belle Carmela. Réveillée au milieu de la nuit par la\\nlueur des flammes, elle avait sauté au bas de son lit, s'était\\nenveloppée de sa robe de chambre, et avait essayé de fuir par la porte;\\nmais le corridor par lequel il fallait passer était déjà la proie de\\nl'incendie. Alors elle était rentrée dans sa chambre, appelant à grands\\ncris du secours, quand tout à coup sa fenêtre, située à vingt pieds du\\nsol, s'était ouverte; un jeune paysan s'était élancé dans l'appartement,\\nl'avait prise dans ses bras, et, avec une force et une adresse\\nsurhumaines l'avait transportée sur le gazon de la pelouse, où elle\\ns'était évanouie. Lorsqu'elle avait repris ses sens, son père était\\ndevant elle. Tous les serviteurs l'entouraient, lui portant des secours.\\nUne aile tout entière de la villa était brûlée; mais qu'importait,\\npuisque Carmela était saine et sauve.\\n\\n«On chercha partout son libérateur, mais son libérateur ne reparut\\npoint; on le demanda à tout le monde, mais personne ne l'avait vu. Quant\\nà Carmela, elle était si troublée qu'elle ne l'avait point reconnu.\\n\\n«Au reste, comme le comte était immensément riche, à part le danger\\nqu'avait couru Carmela, et qui lui parut, par la manière miraculeuse\\ndont elle y avait échappé, plutôt une nouvelle faveur de la Providence\\nqu'un malheur réel, la perte occasionnée par les flammes fut peu de\\nchose pour lui.\\n\\n«Le lendemain, à l'heure habituelle, les deux jeunes gens se\\nretrouvèrent à la lisière de la forêt. Luigi était arrivé le premier. Il\\nvint au-devant de la jeune fille avec une grande gaieté; il semblait\\navoir complètement oublié la scène de la veille. Teresa était\\nvisiblement pensive, mais en voyant Luigi ainsi disposé, elle affecta de\\nson côté l'insouciance rieuse qui était le fond de son caractère quand\\nquelque passion ne le venait pas troubler.\\n\\n«Luigi prit le bras de Teresa sous le sien, et la conduisit jusqu'à la\\nporte de la grotte. Là il s'arrêta. La jeune fille, comprenant qu'il y\\navait quelque chose d'extraordinaire, le regarda fixement.\\n\\n«--Teresa, dit Luigi, hier soir tu m'as dit que tu donnerais tout au\\nmonde pour avoir un costume pareil à celui de la fille du comte?\\n\\n«--Oui, dit Teresa, avec étonnement, mais j'étais folle de faire un\\npareil souhait.\\n\\n«--Et moi, je t'ai répondu: C'est bien, tu l'auras.\\n\\n«--Oui, reprit la jeune fille, dont l'étonnement croissait à chaque\\nparole de Luigi; mais tu as répondu cela sans doute pour me faire\\nplaisir.\\n\\n«--Je ne t'ai jamais rien promis que je ne te l'aie donné, Teresa, dit\\norgueilleusement Luigi; entre dans la grotte et habille-toi.\\n\\n«À ces mots, il tira la pierre, et montra à Teresa la grotte éclairée\\npar deux bougies qui brûlaient de chaque côté d'un magnifique miroir;\\nsur la table rustique, faite par Luigi, étaient étalés le collier de\\nperles et les épingles de diamants; sur une chaise à côté était déposé\\nle reste du costume.\\n\\n«Teresa poussa un cri de joie, et, sans s'informer d'où venait ce\\ncostume, sans prendre le temps de remercier Luigi, elle s'élança dans la\\ngrotte transformée en cabinet de toilette.\\n\\n«Derrière elle Luigi repoussa la pierre, car il venait d'apercevoir, sur\\nla crête d'une petite colline qui empêchait que de la place où il était\\non ne vît Palestrina, un voyageur à cheval, qui s'arrêta un instant\\ncomme incertain de sa route, se dessinant sur l'azur du ciel avec cette\\nnetteté de contour particulière aux lointains des pays méridionaux.\\n\\n«En apercevant Luigi, le voyageur mit son cheval au galop, et vint à\\nlui.\\n\\n«Luigi ne s'était pas trompé; le voyageur, qui allait de Palestrina à\\nTivoli, était dans le doute de son chemin.\\n\\n«Le jeune homme le lui indiqua; mais, comme à un quart de mille de là la\\nroute se divisait en trois sentiers, et qu'arrivé à ces trois sentiers\\nle voyageur pouvait de nouveau s'égarer, il pria Luigi de lui servir de\\nguide.\\n\\n«Luigi détacha son manteau et le déposa à terre, jeta sur son épaule sa\\ncarabine, et, dégagé ainsi du lourd vêtement, marcha devant le voyageur\\nde ce pas rapide du montagnard que le pas d'un cheval a peine à suivre.\\n\\n«En dix minutes, Luigi et le voyageur furent à l'espèce de carrefour\\nindiqué par le jeune pâtre.\\n\\n«Arrivés là, d'un geste majestueux comme celui d'un empereur, il étendit\\nla main vers celle des trois routes que le voyageur devait suivre:\\n\\n«--Voilà votre chemin, dit-il, Excellence, vous n'avez plus à vous\\ntromper maintenant.\\n\\n«--Et toi, voici ta récompense, dit le voyageur en offrant au jeune\\npâtre quelques pièces de menue monnaie.\\n\\n«--Merci, dit Luigi en retirant sa main; je rends un service, je ne le\\nvends pas.\\n\\n«--Mais», dit le voyageur, qui paraissait du reste habitué à cette\\ndifférence entre la servilité de l'homme des villes et l'orgueil du\\ncampagnard, «si tu refuses un salaire, tu acceptes au moins un cadeau.\\n\\n«--Ah! oui, c'est autre chose.\\n\\n«--Eh bien, dit le voyageur, prends ces deux sequins de Venise, et\\ndonne-les à ta fiancée pour en faire une paire de boucles d'oreilles.\\n\\n«--Et vous, alors, prenez ce poignard, dit le jeune pâtre, vous n'en\\ntrouveriez pas un dont la poignée fût mieux sculptée d'Albano à\\nCivita-Castellana.\\n\\n«--J'accepte, dit le voyageur; mais alors, c'est moi qui suis ton\\nobligé, car ce poignard vaut plus de deux sequins.\\n\\n«--Pour un marchand peut-être, mais pour moi, qui l'ai sculpté moi-même,\\nil vaut à peine une piastre.\\n\\n«--Comment t'appelles-tu? demanda le voyageur.\\n\\n«--Luigi Vampa, répondit le pâtre du même air qu'il eût répondu:\\nAlexandre, roi de Macédoine. Et vous?\\n\\n«--Moi, dit le voyageur, je m'appelle Simbad le marin.»\\n\\nFranz d'Épinay jeta un cri de surprise.\\n\\n«Simbad le marin! dit-il.\\n\\n--Oui, reprit le narrateur, c'est le nom que le voyageur donna à Vampa\\ncomme étant le sien.\\n\\n--Eh bien, mais, qu'avez-vous à dire contre ce nom? interrompit Albert;\\nc'est un fort beau nom, et les aventures du patron de ce monsieur m'ont,\\nje dois l'avouer, fort amusé dans ma jeunesse.»\\n\\nFranz n'insista pas davantage. Ce nom de Simbad le marin, comme on le\\ncomprend bien, avait réveillé en lui tout un monde de souvenirs, comme\\navait fait la veille celui du comte de Monte-Cristo.\\n\\n«Continuez, dit-il à l'hôte.\\n\\n--Vampa mit dédaigneusement les deux sequins dans sa poche, et reprit\\nlentement le chemin par lequel il était venu. Arrivé à deux ou trois\\ncents pas de la grotte, il crut entendre un cri.\\n\\n«Il s'arrêta, écoutant de quel côté venait ce cri.\\n\\n«Au bout d'une seconde, il entendit son nom prononcé distinctement.\\n\\n«L'appel venait du côté de la grotte.\\n\\n«Il bondit comme un chamois, armant son fusil tout en courant, et\\nparvint en moins d'une minute au sommet de la colline opposée à celle\\noù il avait aperçu le voyageur.\\n\\n«Là, les cris: Au secours! arrivèrent à lui plus distincts.\\n\\n«Il jeta les yeux sur l'espace qu'il dominait; un homme enlevait Teresa,\\ncomme le centaure Nessus Déjanire.\\n\\n«Cet homme, qui se dirigeait vers le bois, était déjà aux trois quarts\\ndu chemin de la grotte à la forêt.\\n\\n«Vampa mesura l'intervalle; cet homme avait deux cents pas d'avance au\\nmoins sur lui, il n'y avait pas de chance de le rejoindre avant qu'il\\neût gagné le bois.\\n\\n«Le jeune pâtre s'arrêta comme si ses pieds eussent pris racine. Il\\nappuya la crosse de son fusil à l'épaule, leva lentement le canon dans\\nla direction du ravisseur, le suivit une seconde dans sa course et fit\\nfeu.\\n\\n«Le ravisseur s'arrêta court; ses genoux plièrent et il tomba entraînant\\nTeresa dans sa chute.\\n\\n«Mais Teresa se releva aussitôt; quant au fugitif, il resta couché, se\\ndébattant dans les convulsions de l'agonie.\\n\\n«Vampa s'élança aussitôt vers Teresa, car à dix pas du moribond les\\njambes lui avaient manqué à son tour, et elle était retombée à genoux:\\nle jeune homme avait cette crainte terrible que la balle qui venait\\nd'abattre son ennemi n'eût en même temps blessé sa fiancée.\\n\\n«Heureusement il n'en était rien, c'était la terreur seule qui avait\\nparalysé les forces de Teresa. Lorsque Luigi se fut bien assuré qu'elle\\nétait saine et sauve, il se retourna vers le blessé.\\n\\n«Il venait d'expirer les poings fermés, la bouche contractée par la\\ndouleur, et les cheveux hérissés sous la sueur de l'agonie.\\n\\n«Ses yeux étaient restés ouverts et menaçants.\\n\\n«Vampa s'approcha du cadavre, et reconnut Cucumetto.\\n\\n«Depuis le jour où le bandit avait été sauvé par les deux jeunes gens,\\nil était devenu amoureux de Teresa et avait juré que la jeune fille\\nserait à lui. Depuis ce jour il l'avait épiée; et, profitant du moment\\noù son amant l'avait laissée seule pour indiquer le chemin au voyageur,\\nil l'avait enlevée et la croyait déjà à lui, lorsque la balle de Vampa,\\nguidée par le coup d'oeil infaillible du jeune pâtre, lui avait traversé\\nle coeur.\\n\\n«Vampa le regarda un instant sans que la moindre émotion se trahît sur\\nson visage, tandis qu'au contraire Teresa, toute tremblante encore,\\nn'osait se rapprocher du bandit mort qu'à petits pas, et jetait en\\nhésitant un coup d'oeil sur le cadavre par-dessus l'épaule de son amant.\\n\\n«Au bout d'un instant, Vampa se retourna vers sa maîtresse:\\n\\n«--Ah! ah! dit-il, c'est bien, tu es habillée; à mon tour de faire ma\\ntoilette.\\n\\n«En effet, Teresa était revêtue de la tête aux pieds du costume de la\\nfille du comte de San-Felice.\\n\\n«Vampa prit le corps de Cucumetto entre ses bras, l'emporta dans la\\ngrotte, tandis qu'à son tour Teresa restait dehors.\\n\\n«Si un second voyageur fût alors passé, il eût vu une chose étrange:\\nc'était une bergère gardant ses brebis avec une robe de cachemire, des\\nboucles d'oreilles et un collier de perles, des épingles de diamants et\\ndes boutons de saphirs, d'émeraudes et de rubis.\\n\\n«Sans doute, il se fût cru revenu au temps de Florian, et eût affirmé,\\nen revenant à Paris, qu'il avait rencontré la bergère des Alpes assise\\nau pied des monts Sabins.\\n\\n«Au bout d'un quart d'heure, Vampa sortit à son tour de la grotte. Son\\ncostume n'était pas moins élégant, dans son genre, que celui de Teresa.\\n\\n«Il avait une veste de velours grenat à boutons d'or ciselé, un gilet de\\nsoie tout couvert de broderies, une écharpe romaine nouée autour du cou,\\nune cartouchière toute piquée d'or et de soie rouge et verte; des\\nculottes de velours bleu de ciel attachées au-dessous du genou par des\\nboucles de diamants, des guêtres de peau de daim bariolées de mille\\narabesques, et un chapeau où flottaient des rubans de toutes couleurs;\\ndeux montres pendaient à sa ceinture, et un magnifique poignard était\\npassé à sa cartouchière.\\n\\n«Teresa jeta un cri d'admiration. Vampa, sous cet habit, ressemblait à\\nune peinture de Léopold Robert ou de Schnetz.\\n\\n«Il avait revêtu le costume complet de Cucumetto.\\n\\n«Le jeune homme s'aperçut de l'effet qu'il produisait sur sa fiancée, et\\nun sourire d'orgueil passa sur sa bouche.\\n\\n«--Maintenant, dit-il à Teresa, es-tu prête à partager ma fortune\\nquelle qu'elle soit?\\n\\n«--Oh oui! s'écria la jeune fille avec enthousiasme.\\n\\n«--À me suivre partout où j'irai?\\n\\n«--Au bout du monde.\\n\\n«--Alors, prends mon bras et partons, car nous n'avons pas de temps à\\nperdre.»\\n\\n«La jeune fille passa son bras sous celui de son amant, sans même lui\\ndemander où il la conduisait; car, en ce moment, il lui paraissait beau,\\nfier et puissant comme un dieu.\\n\\n«Et tous deux s'avancèrent dans la forêt, dont au bout de quelques\\nminutes, ils eurent franchi la lisière.\\n\\n«Il va sans dire que tous les sentiers de la montagne étaient connus de\\nVampa; il avança donc dans la forêt sans hésiter un seul instant,\\nquoiqu'il n'y eût aucun chemin frayé, mais seulement reconnaissant la\\nroute qu'il devait suivre à la seule inspection des arbres et des\\nbuissons; ils marchèrent ainsi une heure et demie à peu près.\\n\\n«Au bout de ce temps, ils étaient arrivés à l'endroit le plus touffu du\\nbois. Un torrent dont le lit était à sec conduisait dans une gorge\\nprofonde. Vampa prit cet étrange chemin, qui, encaissé entre deux rives\\net rembruni par l'ombre épaisse des pins, semblait, moins la descente\\nfacile, ce sentier de l'Averne dont parle Virgile.\\n\\n«Teresa, redevenue craintive à l'aspect de ce lieu sauvage et désert, se\\nserrait contre son guide, sans dire une parole; mais comme elle le\\nvoyait marcher toujours d'un pas égal, comme un calme profond rayonnait\\nsur son visage, elle avait elle-même la force de dissimuler son émotion.\\n\\n«Tout à coup, à dix pas d'eux, un homme sembla se détacher d'un arbre\\nderrière lequel il était caché, et mettait Vampa en joue:\\n\\n«--Pas un pas de plus! cria-t-il, ou tu es mort.\\n\\n«--Allons donc», dit Vampa en levant la main avec un geste de mépris;\\ntandis que Teresa, ne dissimulant plus sa terreur, se pressait contre\\nlui, «est-ce que les loups se déchirent entre eux!\\n\\n«--Qui es-tu? demanda la sentinelle.\\n\\n«--Je suis Luigi Vampa, le berger de la ferme de San-Felice.\\n\\n«--Que veux-tu?\\n\\n«--Je veux parler à tes compagnons qui sont à la clairière de Rocca\\nBianca.\\n\\n«--Alors, suis-moi, dit la sentinelle, ou plutôt, puisque tu sais où\\ncela est, marche devant.\\n\\n«Vampa sourit d'un air de mépris à cette précaution du bandit, passa\\ndevant avec Teresa et continua son chemin du même pas ferme et\\ntranquille qui l'avait conduit jusque-là.\\n\\n«Au bout de cinq minutes, le bandit leur fit signe de s'arrêter.\\n\\n«Les deux jeunes gens obéirent.\\n\\n«Le bandit imita trois fois le cri du corbeau.\\n\\n«Un croassement répondit à ce triple appel.\\n\\n«--C'est bien, dit le bandit. Maintenant tu peux continuer ta route.»\\n\\n«Luigi et Teresa se remirent en chemin.\\n\\n«Mais à mesure qu'ils avançaient, Teresa, tremblante se serrait contre\\nson amant; en effet, à travers les arbres, on voyait apparaître des\\narmes et étinceler des canons de fusil.\\n\\n«La clairière de Rocca Bianca était au sommet d'une petite montagne qui\\nautrefois sans doute avait été un volcan, volcan éteint avant que Rémus\\net Romulus eussent déserté Albe pour venir bâtir Rome.\\n\\n«Teresa et Luigi atteignirent le sommet et se trouvèrent au même instant\\nen face d'une vingtaine de bandits.\\n\\n«--Voici un jeune homme qui vous cherche et qui désire vous parler, dit\\nla sentinelle.\\n\\n«--Et que veut-il nous dire? demanda celui qui, en l'absence du chef,\\nfaisait l'intérim du capitaine.\\n\\n«--Je veux dire que je m'ennuie de faire le métier de berger, dit Vampa.\\n\\n«--Ah! je comprends, dit le lieutenant, et tu viens nous demander à être\\nadmis dans nos rangs?\\n\\n«--Qu'il soit le bienvenu! crièrent plusieurs bandits de Ferrusino, de\\nPampinara et d'Anagni, qui avaient reconnu Luigi Vampa.\\n\\n«--Oui, seulement je viens vous demander une autre chose que d'être\\nvotre compagnon.\\n\\n«--Et que viens-tu nous demander? dirent les bandits avec étonnement.\\n\\n«--Je viens vous demander à être votre capitaine, dit le jeune homme.\\n\\n«Les bandits éclatèrent de rire.\\n\\n«--Et qu'as-tu fait pour aspirer à cet honneur? demanda le lieutenant.\\n\\n«--J'ai tué votre chef Cucumetto, dont voici la dépouille, dit Luigi, et\\nj'ai mis le feu à la villa de San-Felice pour donner une robe de noce à\\nma fiancée.\\n\\n«Une heure après, Luigi Vampa était élu capitaine en remplacement de\\nCucumetto.\\n\\n--Eh bien, mon cher Albert, dit Franz en se retournant vers son ami, que\\npensez-vous maintenant du citoyen Luigi Vampa?\\n\\n--Je dis que c'est un mythe, répondit Albert, et qu'il n'a jamais\\nexisté.\\n\\n--Qu'est-ce que c'est qu'un mythe? demanda Pastrini.\\n\\n--Ce serait trop long à vous expliquer, mon cher hôte, répondit Franz.\\nEt vous dites donc que maître Vampa exerce en ce moment sa profession\\naux environs de Rome?\\n\\n--Et avec une hardiesse dont jamais bandit avant lui n'avait donné\\nl'exemple.\\n\\n--La police a tenté vainement de s'en emparer, alors?\\n\\n--Que voulez-vous! il est d'accord à la fois avec les bergers de la\\nplaine, les pêcheurs du Tibre et les contrebandiers de la côte. On le\\ncherche dans la montagne, il est sur le fleuve; on le poursuit sur le\\nfleuve, il gagne la pleine mer; puis tout à coup, quand on le croit\\nréfugié dans l'île del Giglio, del Guanouti ou de Monte-Cristo, on le\\nvoit reparaître à Albano, à Tivoli ou à la Riccia.\\n\\n--Et quelle est sa manière de procéder à l'égard des voyageurs?\\n\\n--Ah! mon Dieu! c'est bien simple. Selon la distance où l'on est de la\\nville, il leur donne huit heures, douze heures, un jour, pour payer leur\\nrançon; puis, ce temps écoulé, il accorde une heure de grâce. À la\\nsoixantième minute de cette heure, s'il n'a pas l'argent, il fait sauter\\nla cervelle du prisonnier d'un coup de pistolet, ou lui plante son\\npoignard dans le coeur, et tout est dit.\\n\\n--Eh bien, Albert, demanda Franz à son compagnon, êtes-vous toujours\\ndisposé à aller au Colisée par les boulevards extérieurs?\\n\\n--Parfaitement, dit Albert, si la route est plus pittoresque.»\\n\\nEn ce moment, neuf heures sonnèrent, la porte s'ouvrit et notre cocher\\nparut.\\n\\n«Excellences, dit-il, la voiture vous attend.\\n\\n--Eh bien, dit Franz, en ce cas, au Colisée!\\n\\n--Par la porte del Popolo, Excellences, ou par les rues?\\n\\n--Par les rues, morbleu! par les rues! s'écria Franz.\\n\\n--Ah! mon cher! dit Albert en se levant à son tour et en allumant son\\ntroisième cigare, en vérité, je vous croyais plus brave que cela.»\\n\\nSur ce, les deux jeunes gens descendirent l'escalier et montèrent en\\nvoiture.\",\n",
       " 'XXXIV': \"Franz avait trouvé un terme moyen pour qu'Albert arrivât au Colisée sans\\npasser devant aucune ruine antique, et par conséquent sans que les\\npréparations graduelles ôtassent au colosse une seule coudée de ses\\ngigantesques proportions. C'était de suivre la via Sistinia, de couper à\\nangle droit devant Sainte-Marie-Majeure, et d'arriver par la via Urbana\\net San Pietro in Vincoli jusqu'à la via del Colosseo.\\n\\nCet itinéraire offrait d'ailleurs un autre avantage: c'était celui de ne\\ndistraire en rien Franz de l'impression produite sur lui par l'histoire\\nqu'avait racontée maître Pastrini, et dans laquelle se trouvait mêlé son\\nmystérieux amphitryon de Monte-Cristo. Aussi s'était-il accoudé dans son\\ncoin et était-il retombé dans ces mille interrogatoires sans fin qu'il\\ns'était faits à lui-même et dont pas un ne lui avait donné une réponse\\nsatisfaisante.\\n\\nUne chose, au reste, lui avait encore rappelé son ami Simbad le marin:\\nc'étaient ces mystérieuses relations entre les brigands et les matelots.\\nCe qu'avait dit maître Pastrini du refuge que trouvait Vampa sur les\\nbarques des pécheurs et des contrebandiers rappelait à Franz ces deux\\nbandits corses qu'il avait trouvés soupant avec l'équipage du petit\\nyacht, lequel s'était détourné de son chemin et avait abordé à\\nPorto-Vecchio, dans le seul but de les remettre à terre. Le nom que se\\ndonnait son hôte de Monte-Cristo, prononcé par son hôte de l'hôtel\\nd'Espagne, lui prouvait qu'il jouait le même rôle philanthropique sur\\nles côtes de Piombino, de Civita-Vecchia, d'Ostie et de Gaëte que sur\\ncelles de Corse, de Toscane et d'Espagne; et comme lui-même, autant que\\npouvait se le rappeler Franz, avait parlé de Tunis et de Palerme,\\nc'était une preuve qu'il embrassait un cercle de relations assez étendu.\\n\\nMais si puissantes que fussent sur l'esprit du jeune homme toutes ces\\nréflexions, elles s'évanouirent à l'instant où il vit s'élever devant\\nlui le spectre sombre et gigantesque du Colisée, à travers les\\nouvertures duquel la lune projetait ces longs et pâles rayons qui\\ntombent des yeux des fantômes. La voiture arrêta à quelques pas de la\\nMesa Sudans. Le cocher vint ouvrir la portière; les deux jeunes gens\\nsautèrent à bas de la voiture et se trouvèrent en face d'un cicérone qui\\nsemblait sortir de dessous terre.\\n\\nComme celui de l'hôtel les avait suivis, cela leur en faisait deux.\\n\\nImpossible, au reste, d'éviter à Rome ce luxe des guides outre le\\ncicérone général qui s'empare de vous au moment où vous mettez le pied\\nsur le seuil de la porte de l'hôtel, et qui ne vous abandonne plus que\\nle jour où vous mettez le pied hors de la ville, il y a encore un\\ncicérone spécial attaché à chaque monument, et je dirai presque à chaque\\nfraction du monument. Qu'on juge donc si l'on doit manquer de ciceroni\\nau Colosseo, c'est-à-dire au monument par excellence, qui faisait dire à\\nMartial:\\n\\n«Que Memphis cesse de nous vanter les barbares miracles de ses\\npyramides, que l'on ne chante plus les merveilles de Babylone; tout doit\\ncéder devant l'immense travail de l'amphithéâtre des Césars, toutes les\\nvoix de la renommée doivent se réunir pour vanter ce monument.»\\n\\nFranz et Albert n'essayèrent point de se soustraire à la tyrannie\\ncicéronienne. Au reste, cela serait d'autant plus difficile que ce sont\\nles guides seulement qui ont le droit de parcourir le monument avec des\\ntorches. Ils ne firent donc aucune résistance, et se livrèrent pieds et\\npoings liés à leurs conducteurs.\\n\\nFranz connaissait cette promenade pour l'avoir faite dix fois déjà. Mais\\ncomme son compagnon, plus novice, mettait pour la première fois le pied\\ndans le monument de Flavius Vespasien, je dois l'avouer à sa louange,\\nmalgré le caquetage ignorant de ses guides, il était fortement\\nimpressionné. C'est qu'en effet on n'a aucune idée, quand on ne l'a pas\\nvue, de la majesté d'une pareille ruine, dont toutes les proportions\\nsont doublées encore par la mystérieuse clarté de cette lune méridionale\\ndont les rayons semblent un crépuscule d'Occident.\\n\\nAussi à peine Franz le penseur eut-il fait cent pas sous les portiques\\nintérieurs, qu'abandonnant Albert à ses guides, qui ne voulaient pas\\nrenoncer au droit imprescriptible de lui faire voir dans tous leurs\\ndétails la Fosse des Lions, la Loge des Gladiateurs, le Podium des\\nCésars, il prit un escalier à moitié ruiné et, leur laissant continuer\\nleur route symétrique, il alla tout simplement s'asseoir à l'ombre d'une\\ncolonne, en face d'une échancrure qui lui permettait d'embrasser le\\ngéant de granit dans toute sa majestueuse étendue.\\n\\nFranz était là depuis un quart d'heure à peu près, perdu, comme je l'ai\\ndit, dans l'ombre d'une colonne, occupé à regarder Albert, qui,\\naccompagné de ses deux porteurs de torches, venait de sortir d'un\\nvomitorium placé à l'autre extrémité du Colisée, et lesquels, pareils à\\ndes ombres qui suivent un feu follet, descendaient de gradin en gradin\\nvers les places réservées aux vestales, lorsqu'il lui sembla entendre\\nrouler dans les profondeurs du monument une pierre détachée de\\nl'escalier situé en face de celui qu'il venait de prendre pour arriver à\\nl'endroit où il était assis. Ce n'est pas chose rare sans doute qu'une\\npierre qui se détache sous le pied du temps et va rouler dans l'abîme;\\nmais, cette fois, il lui semblait que c'était aux pieds d'un homme que\\nla pierre avait cédé et qu'un bruit de pas arrivait jusqu'à lui, quoique\\ncelui qui l'occasionnait fît tout ce qu'il put pour l'assourdir.\\n\\nEn effet, au bout d'un instant, un homme parut sortant graduellement de\\nl'ombre à mesure qu'il montait l'escalier, dont l'orifice, situé en face\\nde Franz, était éclairé par la lune, mais dont les degrés, à mesure\\nqu'on les descendait, s'enfonçaient dans l'obscurité.\\n\\nCe pouvait être un voyageur comme lui, préférant une méditation\\nsolitaire au bavardage insignifiant de ses guides, et par conséquent son\\napparition n'avait rien qui pût le surprendre; mais à l'hésitation avec\\nlaquelle il monta les dernières marches, à la façon dont, arrivé sur la\\nplate-forme, il s'arrêta et parut écouter, il était évident qu'il était\\nvenu là dans un but particulier et qu'il attendait quelqu'un.\\n\\nPar un mouvement instinctif, Franz s'effaça le plus qu'il put derrière\\nla colonne.\\n\\nÀ dix pieds du sol où ils se trouvaient tous deux, la voûte était\\nenfoncée, et une ouverture ronde, pareille à celle d'un puits,\\npermettait d'apercevoir le ciel tout constellé d'étoiles.\\n\\nAutour de cette ouverture, qui donnait peut-être déjà depuis des\\ncentaines d'années passage aux rayons de la lune, poussaient des\\nbroussailles dont les vertes et frêles découpures se détachaient en\\nvigueur sur l'azur mat du firmament, tandis que de grandes lianes et de\\npuissants jets de lierre pendaient de cette terrasse supérieure et se\\nbalançaient sous la voûte, pareils à des cordages flottants.\\n\\nLe personnage dont l'arrivée mystérieuse avait attiré l'attention de\\nFranz était placé dans une demi-teinte qui ne lui permettait pas de\\ndistinguer ses traits, mais qui cependant n'était pas assez obscure pour\\nl'empêcher de détailler son costume: il était enveloppé d'un grand\\nmanteau brun dont un des pans, rejeté sur son épaule gauche, lui cachait\\nle bas du visage, tandis que son chapeau à larges bords en couvrait la\\npartie supérieure. L'extrémité seule de ses vêtements se trouvait\\néclairée par la lumière oblique qui passait par l'ouverture, et qui\\npermettait de distinguer un pantalon noir encadrant coquettement une\\nbotte vernie.\\n\\nCet homme appartenait évidemment, sinon à l'aristocratie, du moins à la\\nhaute société.\\n\\nIl était là depuis quelques minutes et commençait à donner des signes\\nvisibles d'impatience, lorsqu'un léger bruit se fit entendre sur la\\nterrasse supérieure.\\n\\nAu même instant une ombre parut intercepter la lumière, un homme apparut\\nà l'orifice de l'ouverture, plongea son regard perçant dans les\\nténèbres, et aperçut l'homme au manteau; aussitôt il saisit une poignée\\nde ces lianes pendantes et de ces lierres flottants, se laissa glisser,\\net, arrivé à trois ou quatre pieds du sol sauta légèrement à terre.\\nCelui-ci avait le costume d'un Transtévère complet.\\n\\n«Excusez-moi, Excellence, dit-il en dialecte romain, je vous ai fait\\nattendre. Cependant, je ne suis en retard que de quelques minutes. Dix\\nheures viennent de sonner à Saint-Jean-de-Latran.\\n\\n--C'est moi qui étais en avance et non vous qui étiez en retard,\\nrépondit l'étranger dans le plus pur toscan; ainsi pas de cérémonie:\\nd'ailleurs m'eussiez-vous fait attendre, que je me serais bien douté que\\nc'était par quelque motif indépendant de votre volonté.\\n\\n--Et vous auriez eu raison, Excellence, je viens du château Saint-Ange,\\net j'ai eu toutes les peines du monde à parler à Beppo.\\n\\n--Qu'est-ce que Beppo?\\n\\n--Beppo est un employé de la prison, à qui je fais une petite rente\\npour savoir ce qui se passe dans l'intérieur du château de Sa Sainteté.\\n\\n--Ah! ah! je vois que vous êtes homme de précaution, mon cher!\\n\\n--Que voulez-vous, Excellence! on ne sait pas ce qui peut arriver;\\npeut-être moi aussi serai-je un jour pris au filet comme ce pauvre\\nPeppino; et aurai-je besoin d'un rat pour ronger quelques mailles de ma\\nprison.\\n\\n--Bref, qu'avez-vous appris?\\n\\n--Il y aura deux exécutions mardi à deux heures comme c'est l'habitude à\\nRome lors des ouvertures des grandes fêtes. Un condamné sera\\n_mazzolato_, c'est un misérable qui a tué un prêtre qui l'avait élevé,\\net qui ne mérite aucun intérêt. L'autre sera _decapitato_, et celui-là,\\nc'est le pauvre Peppino.\\n\\n--Que voulez-vous, mon cher, vous inspirez une si grande terreur, non\\nseulement au gouvernement pontifical mais encore aux royaumes voisins\\nqu'on veut absolument faire un exemple.\\n\\n--Mais Peppino ne fait pas même partie de ma bande; c'est un pauvre\\nberger qui n'a commis d'autre crime que de nous fournir des vivres.\\n\\n--Ce qui le constitue parfaitement votre complice. Aussi, voyez qu'on a\\ndes égards pour lui: au lieu de l'assommer, comme vous le serez, si\\njamais on vous met la main dessus, on se contentera de le guillotiner.\\nAu reste, cela variera les plaisirs du peuple, et il y aura spectacle\\npour tous les goûts.\\n\\n--Sans compter celui que je lui ménage et auquel il ne s'attend pas,\\nreprit le Transtévère.\\n\\n--Mon cher ami, permettez-moi de vous dire, reprit l'homme au manteau,\\nque vous me paraissez tout disposé à faire quelque sottise.\\n\\n--Je suis disposé à tout pour empêcher l'exécution du pauvre diable qui\\nest dans l'embarras pour m'avoir servi; par la Madone! je me regarderai\\ncomme un lâche, si je ne faisais pas quelque chose pour ce brave garçon.\\n\\n\\n--Et que ferez-vous?\\n\\n--Je placerai une vingtaine d'hommes autour de l'échafaud, et, au moment\\noù on l'amènera, au signal que je donnerai, nous nous élancerons le\\npoignard au poing sur l'escorte, et nous l'enlèverons.\\n\\n--Cela me paraît fort chanceux, et je crois décidément que mon projet\\nvaut mieux que le vôtre.\\n\\n--Et quel est votre projet, Excellence?\\n\\n--Je donnerai dix mille piastres à quelqu'un que je sais, et qui\\nobtiendra que l'exécution de Peppino soit remise à l'année prochaine;\\npuis, dans le courant de l'année, je donnerai mille autres piastres à un\\nautre quelqu'un que je sais encore, et le ferai évader de prison.\\n\\n--Êtes-vous sûr de réussir?\\n\\n--Pardieu! dit en français l'homme au manteau.\\n\\n--Plaît-il? demanda le Transtévère.\\n\\n--Je dis, mon cher, que j'en ferai plus à moi seul avec mon or que vous\\net tous vos gens avec leurs poignards, leurs pistolets, leurs carabines\\net leurs tromblons. Laissez-moi donc faire.\\n\\n--À merveille; mais si vous échouez, nous nous tiendrons toujours\\nprêts.\\n\\n--Tenez-vous toujours prêts, si c'est votre plaisir mais soyez certain\\nque j'aurai sa grâce.\\n\\n--C'est après-demain mardi, faites-y attention. Vous n'avez plus que\\ndemain.\\n\\n--Eh bien, mais le jour se compose de vingt-quatre heures, chaque heure\\nse compose de soixante minutes, chaque minute de soixante secondes; en\\nquatre-vingt-six mille quatre cents secondes on fait bien des choses.\\n\\n--Si vous avez réussi, Excellence, comment le saurons-nous?\\n\\n--C'est bien simple. J'ai loué les trois dernières fenêtres du café\\nRospoli; si j'ai obtenu le sursis, les deux fenêtres du coin seront\\ntendues en damas jaune mais celle du milieu sera tendue en damas blanc\\navec une croix rouge.\\n\\n--À merveille. Et par qui ferez-vous passer la grâce?\\n\\n--Envoyez-moi un de vos hommes déguisé en pénitent et je la lui\\ndonnerai. Grâce à son costume, il arrivera jusqu'au pied de l'échafaud\\net remettra la bulle au chef de la confrérie, qui la remettra au\\nbourreau. En attendant, faites savoir cette nouvelle à Peppino; qu'il\\nn'aille pas mourir de peur ou devenir fou, ce qui serait cause que nous\\naurions fait pour lui une dépense inutile.\\n\\n--Écoutez, Excellence, dit le paysan, je vous suis bien dévoué, et vous\\nen êtes convaincu, n'est-ce pas?\\n\\n--Je l'espère, au moins.\\n\\n--Eh bien, si vous sauvez Peppino ce sera plus que du dévouement à\\nl'avenir, ce sera de l'obéissance.\\n\\n--Fais attention à ce que tu dis là, mon cher! je te le rappellerai\\npeut-être un jour, car peut-être un jour moi aussi, j'aurai besoin de\\ntoi....\\n\\n--Eh bien, alors, Excellence, vous me trouverez à l'heure du besoin\\ncomme je vous aurai trouvé à cette même heure; alors, fussiez-vous à\\nl'autre bout du monde, vous n'aurez qu'à m'écrire: «Fais cela», et je le\\nferai, foi de....\\n\\n--Chut! dit l'inconnu, j'entends du bruit.\\n\\n--Ce sont des voyageurs qui visitent le Colisée aux flambeaux.\\n\\n--Il est inutile qu'ils nous trouvent ensemble. Ces mouchards de guides\\npourraient vous reconnaître; et, si honorable que soit votre amitié, mon\\ncher ami, si on nous savait liés comme nous le sommes, cette liaison,\\nj'en ai bien peur, me ferait perdre quelque peu de mon crédit.\\n\\n--Ainsi, si vous avez le sursis?\\n\\n--La fenêtre du milieu tendue en damas avec une croix rouge.\\n\\n--Si vous ne l'avez pas?...\\n\\n--Trois tentures jaunes.\\n\\n--Et alors?...\\n\\n--Alors, mon cher ami, jouez du poignard tout à votre aise, je vous le\\npermets, et je serai là pour vous voir faire.\\n\\n--Adieu, Excellence, je compte sur vous, comptez sur moi.»\\n\\nÀ ces mots le Transtévère disparut par l'escalier, tandis que\\nl'inconnu, se couvrant plus que jamais le visage de son manteau, passa\\nà deux pas de Franz et descendit dans l'arène par les gradins\\nextérieurs.\\n\\nUne seconde après, Franz entendit son nom retentir sous les voûtes:\\nc'était Albert qui l'appelait.\\n\\nIl attendit pour répondre que les deux hommes fussent éloignés, ne se\\nsouciant pas de leur apprendre qu'ils avaient eu un témoin qui, s'il\\nn'avait pas vu leur visage, n'avait pas perdu un mot de leur entretien.\\n\\nDix minutes après, Franz roulait vers l'hôtel d'Espagne, écoutant avec\\nune distraction fort impertinente la savante dissertation qu'Albert\\nfaisait, d'après Pline et Calpurnius, sur les filets garnis de pointes\\nde fer qui empêchaient les animaux féroces de s'élancer sur les\\nspectateurs.\\n\\nIl le laissait aller sans le contredire; il avait hâte de se trouver\\nseul pour penser sans distraction à ce qui venait de se passer devant\\nlui.\\n\\nDe ces deux hommes, l'un lui était certainement étranger, et c'était la\\npremière fois qu'il le voyait et l'entendait, mais il n'en était pas\\nainsi de l'autre; et, quoique Franz n'eût pas distingué son visage\\nconstamment enseveli dans l'ombre ou caché par son manteau, les accents\\nde cette voix l'avaient trop frappé la première fois qu'il les avait\\nentendus pour qu'ils pussent jamais retentir devant lui sans qu'il les\\nreconnût.\\n\\nIl y avait surtout dans les intonations railleuses quelque chose de\\nstrident et de métallique qui l'avait fait tressaillir dans les ruines\\ndu Colisée comme dans la grotte de Monte-Cristo.\\n\\nAussi était-il bien convaincu que cet homme n'était autre que Simbad le\\nmarin.\\n\\nAussi, en toute autre circonstance, la curiosité que lui avait inspirée\\ncet homme eût été si grande qu'il se serait fait reconnaître à lui, mais\\ndans cette occasion, la conversation qu'il venait d'entendre était trop\\nintime pour qu'il ne fût pas retenu par la crainte très sensée que son\\napparition ne lui serait pas agréable. Il l'avait donc laissé\\ns'éloigner, comme on l'a vu, mais en se promettant, s'il le rencontrait\\nune autre fois, de ne pas laisser échapper cette seconde occasion comme\\nil avait fait de la première.\\n\\nFranz était trop préoccupé pour bien dormir. Sa nuit fut employée à\\npasser et repasser dans son esprit toutes les circonstances qui se\\nrattachaient à l'homme de la grotte et à l'inconnu du Colisée, et qui\\ntendaient à faire de ces deux personnages le même individu; et plus\\nFranz y pensait, plus il s'affermissait dans cette opinion.\\n\\nIl s'endormit au jour, et ce qui fit qu'il ne s'éveilla que fort tard.\\nAlbert, en véritable Parisien, avait déjà pris ses précautions pour la\\nsoirée. Il avait envoyé chercher une loge au théâtre Argentina.\\n\\nFranz avait plusieurs lettres à écrire en France, il abandonna donc pour\\ntoute la journée la voiture à Albert.\\n\\nÀ cinq heures, Albert rentra; il avait porté ses lettres de\\nrecommandation, avait des invitations pour toutes ses soirées et avait\\nvu Rome.\\n\\nUne journée avait suffi à Albert pour faire tout cela.\\n\\nEt encore avait-il eu le temps de s'informer de la pièce qu'on jouait et\\ndes acteurs qui la joueraient.\\n\\nLa pièce avait pour titre: _Parisiana_; les acteurs avaient nom:\\nCoselli, Moriani et la Spech.\\n\\nNos deux jeunes gens n'étaient pas si malheureux, comme on le voit: ils\\nallaient assister à la représentation d'un des meilleurs opéras de\\nl'auteur de _Lucia di Lammermoor_, joué par trois des artistes les plus\\nrenommés de l'Italie.\\n\\nAlbert n'avait jamais pu s'habituer aux théâtres ultramontains, à\\nl'orchestre desquels on ne va pas, et qui n'ont ni balcons, ni loges\\ndécouvertes; c'était dur pour un homme qui avait sa stalle aux Bouffes\\net sa part de la loge infernale à l'Opéra.\\n\\nCe qui n'empêchait pas Albert de faire des toilettes flamboyantes toutes\\nles fois qu'il allait à l'Opéra avec Franz; toilettes perdues; car, il\\nfaut l'avouer à la honte d'un des représentants les plus dignes de\\nnotre fashion, depuis quatre mois qu'il sillonnait l'Italie en tous\\nsens, Albert n'avait pas eu une seule aventure.\\n\\nAlbert essayait quelquefois de plaisanter à cet endroit; mais au fond il\\nétait singulièrement mortifié, lui, Albert de Morcerf, un des jeunes\\ngens les plus courus, d'en être encore pour ses frais. La chose était\\nd'autant plus pénible que, selon l'habitude modeste de nos chers\\ncompatriotes, Albert était parti de Paris avec cette conviction qu'il\\nallait avoir en Italie les plus grands succès, et qu'il viendrait faire\\nles délices du boulevard de Gand du récit de ses bonnes fortunes.\\n\\nHélas! il n'en avait rien été: les charmantes comtesses génoises,\\nflorentines et napolitaines s'en étaient tenues, non pas à leurs maris,\\nmais à leurs amants, et Albert avait acquis cette cruelle conviction,\\nque les Italiennes ont du moins sur les Françaises l'avantage d'être\\nfidèles à leur infidélité.\\n\\nJe ne veux pas dire qu'en Italie, comme partout, il n'y ait pas des\\nexceptions.\\n\\nEt cependant Albert était non seulement un cavalier parfaitement\\nélégant, mais encore un homme de beaucoup d'esprit; de plus il était\\nvicomte: de nouvelle noblesse, c'est vrai; mais aujourd'hui qu'on ne\\nfait plus ses preuves, qu'importe qu'on date de 1399 ou de 1815!\\nPar-dessus tout cela il avait cinquante mille livres de rente. C'était\\nplus qu'il n'en faut, comme on le voit, pour être à la mode à Paris.\\nC'était donc quelque peu humiliant de n'avoir encore été sérieusement\\nremarqué par personne dans aucune des villes où il avait passé.\\n\\nMais aussi comptait-il se rattraper à Rome, le carnaval étant, dans tous\\nles pays de la terre qui célèbrent cette estimable institution, une\\népoque de liberté où les plus sévères se laissent entraîner à quelque\\nacte de folie. Or, comme le carnaval s'ouvrait le lendemain, il était\\nfort important qu'Albert lançât son prospectus avant cette ouverture.\\n\\nAlbert avait donc, dans cette intention, loué une des loges les plus\\napparentes du théâtre, et fait, pour s'y rendre, une toilette\\nirréprochable. C'était au premier rang, qui remplace chez nous la\\ngalerie. Au reste, les trois premiers étages sont aussi aristocratiques\\nles uns que les autres, et on les appelle pour cette raison les rangs\\nnobles.\\n\\nD'ailleurs cette loge, où l'on pouvait tenir à douze sans être serrés,\\navait coûté aux deux amis un peu moins cher qu'une loge de quatre\\npersonnes à l'Ambigu.\\n\\nAlbert avait encore un autre espoir, c'est que s'il arrivait à prendre\\nplace dans le coeur d'une belle Romaine, cela le conduirait\\nnaturellement à conquérir un _posto_ dans la voiture, et par conséquent\\nà voir le carnaval du haut d'un véhicule aristocratique ou d'un balcon\\nprincier.\\n\\nToutes ces considérations rendaient donc Albert plus sémillant qu'il ne\\nl'avait jamais été. Il tournait le dos aux acteurs, se penchant à\\nmoitié hors de la loge et lorgnant toutes les jolies femmes avec une\\njumelle de six pouces de long.\\n\\nCe qui n'amenait pas une seule jolie femme à récompenser d'un seul\\nregard, même de curiosité, tout le mouvement que se donnait Albert.\\n\\nEn effet, chacun causait de ses affaires, de ses amours, de ses\\nplaisirs, du carnaval qui s'ouvrait le lendemain de la semaine sainte\\nprochaine, sans faire attention un seul instant ni aux acteurs, ni à la\\npièce, à l'exception des moments indiqués, où chacun alors se\\nretournait, soit pour entendre une portion du récitatif de Coselli, soit\\npour applaudir quelque trait brillant de Moriani, soit pour crier bravo\\nà la Spech; puis les conversations particulières reprenaient leur train\\nhabituel.\\n\\nVers la fin du premier acte, la porte d'une loge restée vide jusque-là\\ns'ouvrit, et Franz vit entrer une personne à laquelle il avait eu\\nl'honneur d'être présenté à Paris et qu'il croyait encore en France.\\nAlbert vit le mouvement que fit son ami à cette apparition, et se\\nretournant vers lui:\\n\\n«Est-ce que vous connaissez cette femme? dit-il.\\n\\n--Oui; comment la trouvez-vous?\\n\\n--Charmante, mon cher, et blonde. Oh! les adorables cheveux! C'est une\\nFrançaise?\\n\\n--C'est une Vénitienne.\\n\\n--Et vous l'appelez?\\n\\n--La comtesse G...\\n\\n--Oh! je la connais de nom, s'écria Albert; on la dit aussi spirituelle\\nque jolie. Parbleu, quand je pense que j'aurais pu me faire présenter à\\nelle au dernier bal de Mme de Villefort, où elle était, et que j'ai\\nnégligé cela: je suis un grand niais!\\n\\n--Voulez-vous que je répare ce tort? demanda Franz.\\n\\n--Comment! vous la connaissez assez pour me conduire dans sa loge?\\n\\n--J'ai eu l'honneur de lui parler trois ou quatre fois dans ma vie;\\nmais, vous le savez, c'est strictement assez pour ne pas commettre une\\ninconvenance.»\\n\\nEn ce moment la comtesse aperçut Franz et lui fit de la main un signe\\ngracieux, auquel il répondit par une respectueuse inclination de tête.\\n\\n«Ah çà! mais il me semble que vous êtes au mieux avec elle? dit Albert.\\n\\n--Eh bien, voilà ce qui vous trompe et ce qui nous fera faire sans\\ncesse, à nous autres Français, mille sottises à l'étranger: c'est de\\ntout soumettre à nos points de vue parisiens; en Espagne, et en Italie\\nsurtout, ne jugez jamais de l'intimité des gens sur la liberté des\\nrapports. Nous nous sommes trouvés en sympathie avec la comtesse, voilà\\ntout.\\n\\n--En sympathie de coeur? demanda Albert en riant.\\n\\n--Non, d'esprit, voilà tout, répondit sérieusement Franz.\\n\\n--Et à quelle occasion?\\n\\n--À l'occasion d'une promenade au Colisée pareille à celle que nous\\navons faite ensemble.\\n\\n--Au clair de la lune?\\n\\n--Oui.\\n\\n--Seuls?\\n\\n--À peu près!\\n\\n--Et vous avez parlé...\\n\\n--Des morts.\\n\\n--Ah! s'écria Albert, c'était en vérité fort récréatif. Eh bien, moi, je\\nvous promets que si j'ai le bonheur d'être le cavalier de la belle\\ncomtesse dans une pareille promenade, je ne lui parlerai que des\\nvivants.\\n\\n--Et vous aurez peut-être tort.\\n\\n--En attendant, vous allez me présenter à elle comme vous me l'avez\\npromis?\\n\\n--Aussitôt la toile baissée.\\n\\n--Que ce diable de premier acte est long!\\n\\n--Écoutez le finale, il est fort beau, et Coselli le chante\\nadmirablement.\\n\\n--Oui, mais quelle tournure!\\n\\n--La Spech y est on ne peut plus dramatique.\\n\\n--Vous comprenez que lorsqu'on a entendu la Sontag et la Malibran....\\n\\n--Ne trouvez-vous pas la méthode de Moriani excellente?\\n\\n--Je n'aime pas les bruns qui chantent blond.\\n\\n--Ah! mon cher, dit Franz en se retournant, tandis qu'Albert continuait\\nde lorgner, en vérité vous êtes par trop difficile!»\\n\\nEnfin la toile tomba à la grande satisfaction du vicomte de Morcerf, qui\\nprit son chapeau, donna un coup de main rapide à ses cheveux, à sa\\ncravate et à ses manchettes, et fit observer à Franz qu'il l'attendait.\\n\\nComme de son côté, la comtesse, que Franz interrogeait des yeux, lui fit\\ncomprendre par un signe, qu'il serait le bienvenu, Franz ne mit aucun\\nretard à satisfaire l'empressement d'Albert, et faisant--suivi de son\\ncompagnon qui profitait du voyage pour rectifier les faux plis que les\\nmouvements avaient pu imprimer à son col de chemise et au revers de son\\nhabit--le tour de l'hémicycle, il vint frapper à la loge n° 4, qui était\\ncelle qu'occupait la comtesse.\\n\\nAussitôt le jeune homme qui était assis à côté d'elle sur le devant de\\nla loge se leva, cédant sa place, selon l'habitude italienne, au\\nnouveau venu, qui doit la céder à son tour lorsqu'une autre visite\\narrive.\\n\\nFranz présenta Albert à la comtesse comme un de nos jeunes gens les plus\\ndistingués par sa position sociale et par son esprit; ce qui,\\nd'ailleurs, était vrai; car à Paris, et dans le milieu où vivait Albert,\\nc'était un cavalier irréprochable. Il ajouta que, désespéré de n'avoir\\npas su profiter du séjour de la comtesse à Paris pour se faire présenter\\nà elle, il l'avait chargé de réparer cette faute, mission dont il\\ns'acquittait en priant la comtesse, près de laquelle il aurait eu besoin\\nlui-même d'un introducteur, d'excuser son indiscrétion.\\n\\nLa comtesse répondit en faisant un charmant salut à Albert et en tendant\\nla main à Franz.\\n\\nAlbert, invité par elle, prit la place vide sur le devant, et Franz\\ns'assit au second rang derrière la comtesse.\\n\\nAlbert avait trouvé un excellent sujet de conversation: c'était Paris,\\nil parlait à la comtesse de leurs connaissances communes. Franz comprit\\nqu'il était sur le terrain. Il le laissa aller, et, lui demandant sa\\ngigantesque lorgnette, il se mit à son tour à explorer la salle.\\n\\nSeule sur le devant d'une loge, placée au troisième rang en face d'eux,\\nétait une femme admirablement belle, vêtue d'un costume grec, qu'elle\\nportait avec tant d'aisance qu'il était évident que c'était son costume\\nnaturel.\\n\\nDerrière elle, dans l'ombre, se dessinait la forme d'un homme dont il\\nétait impossible de distinguer le visage.\\n\\nFranz interrompit la conversation d'Albert et de la comtesse pour\\ndemander à cette dernière si elle connaissait la belle Albanaise qui\\nétait si digne d'attirer non seulement l'attention des hommes, mais\\nencore des femmes.\\n\\n«Non, dit-elle; tout ce que je sais, c'est qu'elle est à Rome depuis le\\ncommencement de la saison; car, à l'ouverture du théâtre, je l'ai vue où\\nelle est, et depuis un mois elle n'a pas manqué une seule\\nreprésentation, tantôt accompagnée de l'homme qui est avec elle en ce\\nmoment, tantôt suivie simplement d'un domestique noir.\\n\\n--Comment la trouvez-vous, comtesse?\\n\\n--Extrêmement belle. Medora devait ressembler à cette femme.»\\n\\nFranz et la comtesse échangèrent un sourire. Elle se remit à causer avec\\nAlbert, et Franz à lorgner son Albanaise.\\n\\nLa toile se leva sur le ballet. C'était un de ces bons ballets italiens\\nmis en scène par le fameux Henri qui s'était fait, comme chorégraphe, en\\nItalie, une réputation colossale, que le malheureux est venu perdre au\\nthéâtre nautique; un de ces ballets où tout le monde, depuis le premier\\nsujet jusqu'au dernier comparse, prend une part si active à l'action,\\nque cent cinquante personnes font à la fois le même geste et lèvent\\nensemble ou le même bras ou la même jambe.\\n\\nOn appelait ce ballet _Poliska_.\\n\\nFranz était trop préoccupé de sa belle Grecque pour s'occuper du ballet,\\nsi intéressant qu'il fût. Quant à elle, elle prenait un plaisir visible\\nà ce spectacle, plaisir qui faisait une opposition suprême avec\\nl'insouciance profonde de celui qui l'accompagnait, et qui, tant que\\ndura le chef-d'oeuvre chorégraphique, ne fit pas un mouvement,\\nparaissant, malgré le bruit infernal que menaient les trompettes, les\\ncymbales et les chapeaux chinois à l'orchestre, goûter les célestes\\ndouceurs d'un sommeil paisible et radieux.\\n\\nEnfin le ballet finit, et la toile tomba au milieu des applaudissements\\nfrénétiques d'un parterre enivré.\\n\\nGrâce à cette habitude de couper l'opéra par un ballet, les entractes\\nsont très courts en Italie, les chanteurs ayant le temps de se reposer\\net de changer de costume tandis que les danseurs exécutent leurs\\npirouettes et confectionnent leurs entrechats.\\n\\nL'ouverture du second acte commença; aux premiers coups d'archet, Franz\\nvit le dormeur se soulever lentement et se rapprocher de la Grecque, qui\\nse retourna pour lui adresser quelques paroles, et s'accouda de nouveau\\nsur le devant de la loge.\\n\\nLa figure de son interlocuteur était toujours dans l'ombre, et Franz ne\\npouvait distinguer aucun de ses traits.\\n\\nLa toile se leva, l'attention de Franz fut nécessairement attirée par\\nles acteurs, et ses yeux quittèrent un instant la loge de la belle\\nGrecque pour se porter vers la scène.\\n\\nL'acte s'ouvre, comme on sait, par le duo du rêve: Parisina, couchée,\\nlaisse échapper devant Azzo le secret de son amour pour Ugo; l'époux\\ntrahi passe par toutes les fureurs de la jalousie, jusqu'à ce que,\\nconvaincu que sa femme lui est infidèle, il la réveille pour lui\\nannoncer sa prochaine vengeance.\\n\\nCe duo est un des plus beaux, des plus expressifs et des plus terribles\\nqui soient sortis de la plume féconde de Donizetti. Franz l'entendait\\npour la troisième fois, et quoiqu'il ne passât pas pour un mélomane\\nenragé, il produisit sur lui un effet profond. Il allait en conséquence\\njoindre ses applaudissements à ceux de la salle, lorsque ses mains,\\nprêtes à se réunir, restèrent écartées, et que le bravo qui s'échappait\\nde sa bouche expira sur ses lèvres.\\n\\nL'homme de la loge s'était levé tout debout, et, sa tête se trouvant\\ndans la lumière, Franz venait de retrouver le mystérieux habitant de\\nMonte-Cristo, celui dont la veille il lui avait si bien semblé\\nreconnaître la taille et la voix dans les ruines du Colisée.\\n\\nIl n'y avait plus de doute, l'étrange voyageur habitait Rome.\\n\\nSans doute l'expression de la figure de Franz était en harmonie avec le\\ntrouble que cette apparition jetait dans son esprit, car la comtesse le\\nregarda, éclata de rire, et lui demanda ce qu'il avait.\\n\\n«Madame la comtesse, répondit Franz, je vous ai demandé tout à l'heure\\nsi vous connaissiez cette femme albanaise: maintenant je vous demanderai\\nsi vous connaissez son mari.\\n\\n--Pas plus qu'elle, répondit la comtesse.\\n\\n--Vous ne l'avez jamais remarqué?\\n\\n--Voilà bien une question à la française! Vous savez bien que, pour nous\\nautres Italiennes, il n'y a pas d'autre homme au monde que celui que\\nnous aimons!\\n\\n--C'est juste, répondit Franz.\\n\\n--En tout cas, dit-elle en appliquant les jumelles d'Albert à ses yeux\\net en les dirigeant vers la loge, ce doit être quelque nouveau déterré,\\nquelque trépassé sorti du tombeau avec la permission du fossoyeur car il\\nme semble affreusement pâle.\\n\\n--Il est toujours comme cela, répondit Franz.\\n\\n--Vous le connaissez donc? demanda la comtesse; alors c'est moi qui vous\\ndemanderai qui il est.\\n\\n--Je crois l'avoir déjà vu, et il me semble le reconnaître.\\n\\n--En effet, dit-elle en faisant un mouvement de ses belles épaules comme\\nsi un frisson lui passait dans les veines, je comprends que lorsqu'on a\\nune fois vu un pareil homme on ne l'oublie jamais.»\\n\\nL'effet que Franz avait éprouvé n'était donc pas une impression\\nparticulière, puisqu'une autre personne le ressentait comme lui.\\n\\n«Eh bien, demanda Franz à la comtesse après qu'elle eut pris sur elle de\\nle lorgner une seconde fois que pensez-vous de cet homme?\\n\\n--Que cela me paraît être Lord Ruthwen en chair et en os.»\\n\\nEn effet, ce nouveau souvenir de Byron frappa Franz: si un homme\\npouvait lui faire croire à l'existence des vampires, c'était cet homme.\\n\\n«Il faut que je sache qui il est, dit Franz en se levant.\\n\\n--Oh! non, s'écria la comtesse; non, ne me quittez pas, je compte sur\\nvous pour me reconduire, et je vous garde.\\n\\n--Comment! véritablement, lui dit Franz en se penchant à son oreille,\\nvous avez peur?\\n\\n--Écoutez, lui dit-elle, Byron m'a juré qu'il croyait aux vampires, il\\nm'a dit qu'il en avait vu, il m'a dépeint leur visage, eh bien! c'est\\nabsolument cela: ces cheveux noirs, ces grands yeux brillant d'une\\nflamme étrange, cette pâleur mortelle; puis, remarquez qu'il n'est pas\\navec une femme comme toutes les femmes, il est avec une étrangère... une\\nGrecque, une schismatique... sans doute quelque magicienne comme lui. Je\\nvous en prie, n'y allez pas. Demain mettez-vous à sa recherche si bon\\nvous semble, mais aujourd'hui je vous déclare que je vous garde.»\\n\\nFranz insista.\\n\\n«Écoutez, dit-elle en se levant, je m'en vais, je ne puis rester jusqu'à\\nla fin du spectacle, j'ai du monde chez moi: serez-vous assez peu galant\\npour me refuser votre compagnie?»\\n\\nIl n'y avait d'autre réponse à faire que de prendre son chapeau,\\nd'ouvrir la porte et de présenter son bras à la comtesse.\\n\\nC'est ce qu'il fit.\\n\\nLa comtesse était véritablement fort émue; et Franz lui-même ne pouvait\\néchapper à une certaine terreur superstitieuse, d'autant plus naturelle\\nque ce qui était chez la comtesse le produit d'une sensation\\ninstinctive, était chez lui le résultat d'un souvenir.\\n\\nIl sentit qu'elle tremblait en montant en voiture.\\n\\nIl la reconduisit jusque chez elle: il n'y avait personne, et elle\\nn'était aucunement attendue; il lui en fit le reproche.\\n\\n«En vérité, lui dit-elle, je ne me sens pas bien, et j'ai besoin d'être\\nseule; la vue de cet homme m'a toute bouleversée.»\\n\\nFranz essaya de rire.\\n\\n«Ne riez pas, lui dit-elle; d'ailleurs vous n'en avez pas envie. Puis\\npromettez-moi une chose.\\n\\n--Laquelle?\\n\\n--Promettez-la-moi.\\n\\n--Tout ce que vous voudrez, excepté de renoncer à découvrir quel est cet\\nhomme. J'ai des motifs que je ne puis vous dire pour désirer savoir qui\\nil est, d'où il vient et où il va.\\n\\n--D'où il vient, je l'ignore; mais où il va, je puis vous le dire: il va\\nen enfer à coup sûr.\\n\\n--Revenons à la promesse que vous vouliez exiger de moi, comtesse, dit\\nFranz.\\n\\n--Ah! c'est de rentrer directement à l'hôtel et de ne pas chercher ce\\nsoir à voir cet homme. Il y a certaines affinités entre les personnes\\nque l'on quitte et les personnes que l'on rejoint. Ne servez pas de\\nconducteur entre cet homme et moi. Demain courez après lui si bon vous\\nsemble, mais ne me le présentez jamais, si vous ne voulez pas me faire\\nmourir de peur. Sur ce, bonsoir, tâchez de dormir, moi, je sais bien qui\\nne dormira pas.»\\n\\nEt à ces mots la comtesse quitta Franz, le laissant indécis de savoir si\\nelle s'était amusée à ses dépens ou si elle avait véritablement ressenti\\nla crainte qu'elle avait exprimée.\\n\\nEn rentrant à l'hôtel, Franz trouva Albert en robe de chambre, en\\npantalon à pied, voluptueusement étendu sur un fauteuil et fumant son\\ncigare.\\n\\n«Ah! c'est vous! lui dit-il; ma foi, je ne vous attendais que demain.\\n\\n--Mon cher Albert, répondit Franz, je suis heureux de trouver l'occasion\\nde vous dire une fois pour toutes que vous avez la plus fausse idée des\\nfemmes italiennes; il me semble pourtant que vos mécomptes amoureux\\nauraient dû vous la faire perdre.\\n\\n--Que voulez-vous! ces diablesses de femmes, c'est à n'y rien\\ncomprendre! Elles vous donnent la main, elles vous la serrent; elles\\nvous parlent tout bas, elles se font reconduire chez elles: avec le\\nquart de ces manières de faire, une Parisienne se perdrait de\\nréputation.\\n\\n--Eh! justement, c'est parce qu'elles n'ont rien à cacher, c'est parce\\nqu'elles vivent au grand soleil, que les femmes y mettent si peu de\\nfaçons dans le beau pays où résonne le si, comme dit Dante. D'ailleurs,\\nvous avez bien vu que la comtesse a eu véritablement peur.\\n\\n--Peur de quoi? de cet honnête monsieur qui était en face de nous avec\\ncette jolie Grecque? Mais j'ai voulu en avoir le coeur net quand ils\\nsont sortis, et je les ai croisés dans le corridor. Je ne sais pas où\\ndiable vous avez pris toutes vos idées de l'autre monde! C'est un fort\\nbeau garçon qui est fort bien mis, et qui a tout l'air de se faire\\nhabiller en France chez Blin ou chez Humann; un peu pâle, c'est vrai,\\nmais vous savez que la pâleur est un cachet de distinction.»\\n\\nFranz sourit, Albert avait de grandes prétentions à être pâle.\\n\\n«Aussi, lui dit Franz, je suis convaincu que les idées de la comtesse\\nsur cet homme n'ont pas le sens commun. A-t-il parlé près de vous, et\\navez-vous entendu quelques-unes de ses paroles?\\n\\n--Il a parlé, mais en romaïque. J'ai reconnu l'idiome à quelques mots\\ngrecs défigurés. Il faut vous dire, mon cher, qu'au collège j'étais très\\nfort en grec.\\n\\n--Ainsi il parlait le romaïque?\\n\\n--C'est probable.\\n\\n--Plus de doute, murmura Franz, c'est lui.\\n\\n--Vous dites?...\\n\\n--Rien. Que faisiez-vous donc là?\\n\\n--Je vous ménageais une surprise.\\n\\n--Laquelle?\\n\\n--Vous savez qu'il est impossible de se procurer une calèche?\\n\\n--Pardieu! puisque nous avons fait inutilement tout ce qu'il était\\nhumainement possible de faire pour cela.\\n\\n--Eh bien, j'ai eu une idée merveilleuse.»\\n\\nFranz regarda Albert en homme qui n'avait pas grande confiance dans son\\nimagination.\\n\\n«Mon cher, dit Albert, vous m'honorez là d'un regard qui mériterait\\nbien que je vous demandasse réparation.\\n\\n--Je suis prêt à vous la faire, cher ami, si l'idée est aussi ingénieuse\\nque vous le dites.\\n\\n--Écoutez.\\n\\n--J'écoute.\\n\\n--Il n'y a pas moyen de se procurer de voiture, n'est-ce pas?\\n\\n--Non.\\n\\n--Ni de chevaux?\\n\\n--Pas davantage.\\n\\n--Mais l'on peut se procurer une charrette?\\n\\n--Peut-être.\\n\\n--Une paire de boeufs?\\n\\n--C'est probable.\\n\\n--Eh bien, mon cher! voilà notre affaire. Je vais faire décorer la\\ncharrette, nous nous habillons en moissonneurs napolitains, et nous\\nreprésentons au naturel le magnifique tableau de Léopold Robert. Si\\npour plus grande ressemblance, la comtesse veut prendre le costume d'une\\nfemme de Pouzzole ou de Sorrente, cela complétera la mascarade, et elle\\nest assez belle pour qu'on la prenne pour l'original de la Femme à\\nl'Enfant.\\n\\n--Pardieu! s'écria Franz, pour cette fois vous avez raison, monsieur\\nAlbert, et voilà une idée véritablement heureuse.\\n\\n--Et toute nationale, renouvelée des rois fainéants, mon cher, rien que\\ncela! Ah! messieurs les Romains, vous croyez qu'on courra à pied par vos\\nrues comme des lazzaroni, et cela parce que vous manquez de calèches et\\nde chevaux; eh bien! on en inventera.\\n\\n--Et avez-vous déjà fait part à quelqu'un de cette triomphante\\nimagination?\\n\\n--À notre hôte. En rentrant, je l'ai fait monter et lui ai exposé mes\\ndésirs. Il m'a assuré que rien n'était plus facile; je voulais faire\\ndorer les cornes des boeufs, mais il m'a dit que cela demandait trois\\njours: il faudra donc nous passer de cette superfluité.\\n\\n--Et où est-il?\\n\\n--Qui?\\n\\n--Notre hôte?\\n\\n--En quête de la chose. Demain il serait déjà peut-être un peu tard.\\n\\n--De sorte qu'il va nous rendre réponse ce soir même?\\n\\n--Je l'attends.»\\n\\nEn ce moment la porte s'ouvrit, et maître Pastrini passa la tête.\\n\\n«_Permesso_? dit-il.\\n\\n--Certainement que c'est permis! s'écria Franz.\\n\\n--Eh bien, dit Albert, nous avez-vous trouvé la charrette requise et les\\nboeufs demandés?\\n\\n--J'ai trouvé mieux que cela, répondit-il d'un air parfaitement\\nsatisfait de lui-même.\\n\\n--Ah! mon cher hôte, prenez garde, dit Albert, le mieux est l'ennemi du\\nbien.\\n\\n--Que Vos Excellences s'en rapportent à moi, dit maître Pastrini d'un\\nton capable.\\n\\n--Mais enfin qu'y a-t-il? demanda Franz à son tour.\\n\\n--Vous savez, dit l'aubergiste, que le comte de Monte-Cristo habite sur\\nle même carré que vous?\\n\\n--Je le crois bien, dit Albert, puisque c'est grâce à lui que nous\\nsommes logés comme deux étudiants de la rue Saint-Nicolas-du-Chardonnet.\\n\\n--Eh bien, il sait l'embarras dans lequel vous vous trouvez, et vous\\nfait offrir deux places dans sa voiture et deux places à ses fenêtres du\\npalais Rospoli.»\\n\\nAlbert et Franz se regardèrent.\\n\\n«Mais, demanda Albert, devons-nous accepter l'offre de cet étranger,\\nd'un homme que nous ne connaissons pas?\\n\\n--Quel homme est-ce que ce comte de Monte-Cristo? demanda Franz à son\\nhôte.\\n\\n--Un très grand seigneur sicilien ou maltais, je ne sais pas au juste,\\nmais noble comme un Borghèse et riche comme une mine d'or.\\n\\n--Il me semble, dit Franz à Albert, que, si cet homme était d'aussi\\nbonnes manières que le dit notre hôte, il aurait dû nous faire parvenir\\nson invitation d'une autre façon, soit en nous écrivant, soit....\\n\\nEn ce moment on frappa à la porte.\\n\\n«Entrez», dit Franz.\\n\\nUn domestique, vêtu d'une livrée parfaitement élégante, parut sur le\\nseuil de la chambre.\\n\\n«De la part du comte de Monte-Cristo, pour M. Franz d'Épinay et pour M.\\nle vicomte Albert de Morcerf», dit-il.\\n\\nEt il présenta à l'hôte deux cartes, que celui-ci remit aux jeunes gens.\\n\\n«M. le comte de Monte-Cristo, continua le domestique, fait demander à\\nces messieurs la permission de se présenter en voisin demain matin chez\\neux; il aura l'honneur de s'informer auprès de ces messieurs à quelle\\nheure ils seront visibles.\\n\\n--Ma foi, dit Albert à Franz, il n'y a rien à y reprendre, tout y est.\\n\\n--Dites au comte, répondit Franz, que c'est nous qui aurons l'honneur de\\nlui faire notre visite.\\n\\nLe domestique se retira.\\n\\n«Voilà ce qui s'appelle faire assaut d'élégance, dit Albert; allons,\\ndécidément vous aviez raison, maître Pastrini, et c'est un homme tout à\\nfait comme il faut que votre comte de Monte-Cristo.\\n\\n--Alors vous acceptez son offre? dit l'hôte.\\n\\n--Ma foi, oui, répondit Albert. Cependant, je vous l'avoue, je regrette\\nnotre charrette et les moissonneurs; et, s'il n'y avait pas la fenêtre\\ndu palais Rospoli pour faire compensation à ce que nous perdons, je\\ncrois que j'en reviendrais à ma première idée: qu'en dites-vous, Franz?\\n\\n--Je dis que ce sont aussi les fenêtres du palais Rospoli qui me\\ndécident», répondit Franz à Albert.\\n\\nEn effet, cette offre de deux places à une fenêtre du palais Rospoli\\navait rappelé à Franz la conversation qu'il avait entendue dans les\\nruines du Colisée entre son inconnu et son Transtévère, conversation\\ndans laquelle l'engagement avait été pris par l'homme au manteau\\nd'obtenir la grâce du condamné. Or, si l'homme au manteau était, comme\\ntout portait Franz à le croire, le même que celui dont l'apparition dans\\nla salle Argentina l'avait si fort préoccupé, il le reconnaîtrait sans\\naucun doute, et alors rien ne l'empêcherait de satisfaire sa curiosité\\nà son égard.\\n\\nFranz passa une partie de la nuit à rêver à ses deux apparitions et à\\ndésirer le lendemain. En effet, le lendemain tout devait s'éclaircir; et\\ncette fois, à moins que son hôte de Monte-Cristo ne possédât l'anneau de\\nGygès et, grâce à cet anneau, la faculté de se rendre invisible, il\\nétait évident qu'il ne lui échapperait pas. Aussi fut-il éveillé avant\\nhuit heures.\\n\\nQuant à Albert, comme il n'avait pas les mêmes motifs que Franz d'être\\nmatinal, il dormait encore de son mieux.\\n\\nFranz fit appeler son hôte, qui se présenta avec son obséquiosité\\nordinaire.\\n\\n«Maître Pastrini, lui dit-il, ne doit-il pas y avoir aujourd'hui une\\nexécution?\\n\\n--Oui, Excellence; mais si vous me demandez cela pour avoir une fenêtre,\\nvous vous y prenez bien tard.\\n\\n--Non, reprit Franz; d'ailleurs, si je tenais absolument à voir ce\\nspectacle, je trouverais place, je pense, sur le mont Pincio.\\n\\n--Oh! je présumais que Votre Excellence ne voudrait pas se compromettre\\navec toute la canaille, dont c'est en quelque sorte l'amphithéâtre\\nnaturel.\\n\\n--Il est probable que je n'irai pas, dit Franz; mais je désirerais\\navoir quelques détails.\\n\\n--Lesquels?\\n\\n--Je voudrais savoir le nombre des condamnés, leurs noms et le genre de\\nleur supplice.\\n\\n--Cela tombe à merveille, Excellence! on vient justement de m'apporter\\nles _tavolette_.\\n\\n--Qu'est-ce que les _tavolette_?\\n\\n--Les _tavolette_ sont des tablettes en bois que l'on accroche à tous\\nles coins de rue la veille des exécutions, et sur lesquelles on colle\\nles noms des condamnés, la cause de leur condamnation et le mode de\\nleur supplice. Cet avis a pour but d'inviter les fidèles à prier Dieu de\\ndonner aux coupables un repentir sincère.\\n\\n--Et l'on vous apporte ces _tavolette_ pour que vous joigniez vos\\nprières à celles des fidèles? demanda Franz d'un air de doute.\\n\\n--Non, Excellence; je me suis entendu avec le colleur, et il m'apporte\\ncela comme il m'apporte les affiches de spectacles, afin que si\\nquelques-uns de mes voyageurs désirent assister à l'exécution, ils\\nsoient prévenus.\\n\\n--Ah! mais c'est une attention tout à fait délicate! s'écria Franz.\\n\\n--Oh! dit maître Pastrini en souriant, je puis me vanter de faire tout\\nce qui est en mon pouvoir pour satisfaire les nobles étrangers qui\\nm'honorent de leur confiance.\\n\\n--C'est ce que je vois, mon hôte! et c'est ce que je répéterai à qui\\nvoudra l'entendre, soyez en bien certain. En attendant, je désirerais\\nlire une de ces _tavolette_.\\n\\n--C'est bien facile, dit l'hôte en ouvrant la porte, j'en ai fait mettre\\nune sur le carré.»\\n\\nIl sortit, détacha la _tavoletta_, et la présenta à Franz.\\n\\nVoici la traduction littérale de l'affiche patibulaire:\\n\\n«On fait savoir à tous que le mardi 22 février, premier jour de\\ncarnaval, seront, par arrêt du tribunal de la Rota, exécutés, sur la\\nplace del Popolo le nommé Andrea Rondolo, coupable d'assassinat sur la\\npersonne très respectable et très vénérée de don César Terlini, chanoine\\nde l'église de Saint-Jean de Latran, et le nommé Peppino, dit _Rocca\\nPriori_, convaincu de complicité avec le détestable bandit Luigi Vampa et\\nles hommes de sa troupe.\\n\\n«Le premier sera _mazzolato_.\\n\\n«Et le second _decapitato_.\\n\\n«Les âmes charitables sont priées de demander à Dieu un repentir sincère\\npour ces deux malheureux condamnés.»\\n\\nC'était bien ce que Franz avait entendu la surveille, dans les ruines du\\nColisée, et rien n'était changé au programme: les noms des condamnés, la\\ncause de leur supplice et le genre de leur exécution étaient exactement\\nles mêmes.\\n\\nAinsi, selon toute probabilité, le Transtévère n'était autre que le\\nbandit Luigi Vampa, et l'homme au manteau Simbad le marin, qui, à Rome\\ncomme à Porto-Vecchio, et à Tunis, poursuivait le cours de ses\\nphilanthropiques expéditions.\\n\\nCependant le temps s'écoulait, il était neuf heures, et Franz allait\\nréveiller Albert, lorsque à son grand étonnement il le vit sortir tout\\nhabillé de sa chambre. Le carnaval lui avait trotté par la tête, et\\nl'avait éveillé plus matin que son ami ne l'espérait.\\n\\n«Eh bien, dit Franz à son hôte, maintenant que nous voilà prêts tous\\ndeux, croyez-vous, mon cher monsieur Pastrini, que nous puissions nous\\nprésenter chez le comte de Monte-Cristo?\\n\\n--Oh! bien certainement! répondit-il; le comte de Monte-Cristo a\\nl'habitude d'être très matinal, et je suis sûr qu'il y a plus de deux\\nheures déjà qu'il est levé.\\n\\n--Et vous croyez qu'il n'y a pas d'indiscrétion à se présenter chez lui\\nmaintenant?\\n\\n--Aucune.\\n\\n--En ce cas, Albert, si vous êtes prêt....\\n\\n--Entièrement prêt, dit Albert.\\n\\n--Allons remercier notre voisin de sa courtoisie.\\n\\n--Allons!\\n\\nFranz et Albert n'avaient que le carré à traverser, l'aubergiste les\\ndevança et sonna pour eux; un domestique vint ouvrir.\\n\\n«_I Signori Francesi_», dit l'hôte.\\n\\nLe domestique s'inclina et leur fit signe d'entrer.\\n\\nIls traversèrent deux pièces meublées avec un luxe, qu'ils ne croyaient\\npas trouver dans l'hôtel de maître Pastrini, et ils arrivèrent enfin\\ndans un salon d'une élégance parfaite. Un tapis de Turquie était tendu\\nsur le parquet, et les meubles les plus confortables offraient leurs\\ncoussins rebondis et leurs dossiers renversés. De magnifiques tableaux\\nde maîtres, entremêlés de trophées d'armes splendides, étaient suspendus\\naux murailles, et de grandes portières de tapisserie flottaient devant\\nles portes.\\n\\n«Si Leurs Excellences veulent s'asseoir, dit le domestique, je vais\\nprévenir M. le comte.»\\n\\nEt il disparut par une des portes.\\n\\nAu moment où cette porte s'ouvrit, le son d'une _guzla_ arriva\\njusqu'aux deux amis, mais s'éteignit aussitôt: la porte, refermée\\npresque en même temps qu'ouverte, n'avait pour ainsi dire laissé\\npénétrer dans le salon qu'une bouffée d'harmonie.\\n\\nFranz et Albert échangèrent un regard et reportèrent les yeux sur les\\nmeubles, sur les tableaux et sur les armes. Tout cela, à la seconde vue,\\nleur parut encore plus magnifique qu'à la première.\\n\\n«Eh bien, demanda Franz à son ami, que dites-vous de cela?\\n\\n--Ma foi, mon cher, je dis qu'il faut que notre voisin soit quelque\\nagent de change qui a joué à la baisse sur les fonds espagnols, ou\\nquelque prince qui voyage incognito.\\n\\n--Chut! lui dit Franz; c'est ce que nous allons savoir, car le voilà.»\\n\\nEn effet, le bruit d'une porte tournant sur ses gonds venait d'arriver\\njusqu'aux visiteurs; et presque aussitôt la tapisserie, se soulevant,\\ndonna passage au propriétaire de toutes ces richesses.\\n\\nAlbert s'avança au-devant de lui, mais Franz resta cloué à sa place.\\n\\nCelui qui venait d'entrer n'était autre que l'homme au manteau du\\nColisée, l'inconnu de la loge, l'hôte mystérieux de Monte-Cristo.\",\n",
       " 'XXXV': \"«Messieurs, dit en entrant le comte de Monte-Cristo, recevez toutes mes\\nexcuses de ce que je me suis laissé prévenir, mais en me présentant de\\nmeilleure heure chez vous, j'aurais craint d'être indiscret. D'ailleurs\\nvous m'avez fait dire que vous viendriez, et je me suis tenu à votre\\ndisposition.\\n\\n--Nous avons, Franz et moi, mille remerciements à vous présenter,\\nmonsieur le comte, dit Albert; vous nous tirez véritablement d'un grand\\nembarras, et nous étions en train d'inventer les véhicules les plus\\nfantastiques au moment où votre gracieuse invitation nous est parvenue.\\n\\n--Eh! mon Dieu! messieurs, reprit le comte en faisant signe aux deux\\njeunes gens de s'asseoir sur un divan, c'est la faute de cet imbécile de\\nPastrini, si je vous ai laissés si longtemps dans la détresse! Il ne\\nm'avait pas dit un mot de votre embarras, à moi qui, seul et isolé comme\\nje le suis ici, ne cherchais qu'une occasion de faire connaissance avec\\nmes voisins. Du moment où j'ai appris que je pouvais vous être bon à\\nquelque chose, vous avez vu avec quel empressement j'ai saisi cette\\noccasion de vous présenter mes compliments.»\\n\\nLes deux jeunes gens s'inclinèrent. Franz n'avait pas encore trouvé un\\nseul mot à dire; il n'avait encore pris aucune résolution, et, comme\\nrien n'indiquait dans le comte sa volonté de le reconnaître ou le désir\\nd'être reconnu de lui, il ne savait pas s'il devait, par un mot\\nquelconque, faire allusion au passé, ou laisser le temps à l'avenir de\\nlui apporter de nouvelles preuves. D'ailleurs, sûr que c'était lui qui\\nétait la veille dans la loge, il ne pouvait répondre aussi positivement\\nque ce fût lui qui la surveille, était au Colisée, il résolut donc de\\nlaisser aller les choses sans faire au comte aucune ouverture directe.\\nD'ailleurs il avait une supériorité sur lui, il était maître de son\\nsecret, tandis qu'au contraire il ne pouvait avoir aucune action sur\\nFranz, qui n'avait rien à cacher.\\n\\nCependant il résolut de faire tomber la conversation sur un point qui\\npouvait, en attendant, amener toujours l'éclaircissement de certains\\ndoutes.\\n\\n«Monsieur le comte, lui dit-il, vous nous avez offert des places dans\\nvotre voiture et des places à vos fenêtres du palais Rospoli;\\nmaintenant, pourriez-vous nous dire comment nous pourrons nous procurer\\nun poste quelconque, comme on dit en Italie, sur la place del Popolo?\\n\\n--Ah! oui, c'est vrai, dit le comte d'un air distrait et en regardant\\nMorcerf avec une attention soutenue; n'y a-t-il pas, place del Popolo,\\nquelque chose comme une exécution?\\n\\n--Oui, répondit Franz, voyant qu'il venait de lui-même où il voulait\\nl'amener.\\n\\n--Attendez, attendez, je crois avoir dit hier à mon intendant de\\ns'occuper de cela; peut-être pourrai-je vous rendre encore ce petit\\nservice.»\\n\\nIl allongea la main vers un cordon de sonnette, qu'il tira trois fois.\\n\\n«Vous êtes-vous préoccupé jamais, dit-il à Franz, de l'emploi du temps\\net du moyen de simplifier les allées et venues des domestiques? Moi,\\nj'en ai fait une étude: quand je sonne une fois, c'est pour mon valet de\\nchambre; deux fois, c'est pour mon maître d'hôtel; trois fois, c'est\\npour mon intendant. De cette façon, je ne perds ni une minute ni une\\nparole. Tenez, voici notre homme.»\\n\\nOn vit alors entrer un individu de quarante-cinq à cinquante ans, qui\\nparut à Franz ressembler comme deux gouttes d'eau au contrebandier qui\\nl'avait introduit dans la grotte, mais qui ne parut pas le moins du\\nmonde le reconnaître. Il vit que le mot était donné.\\n\\n«Monsieur Bertuccio, dit le comte, vous êtes-vous occupé, comme je vous\\nl'avais ordonné hier, de me procurer une fenêtre sur la place del\\nPopolo?\\n\\n--Oui, Excellence, répondit l'intendant, mais il était bien tard.\\n\\n--Comment! dit le comte en fronçant le sourcil, ne vous ai-je pas dit\\nque je voulais en avoir une?\\n\\n--Et Votre Excellence en a une aussi, celle qui était louée au prince\\nLobanieff; mais j'ai été obligé de la payer cent....\\n\\n--C'est bien, c'est bien, monsieur Bertuccio, faites grâce à ces\\nmessieurs de tous ces détails de ménage; vous avez la fenêtre, c'est\\ntout ce qu'il faut. Donnez l'adresse de la maison au cocher, et\\ntenez-vous sur l'escalier pour nous conduire: cela suffit; allez.\\n\\nL'intendant salua et fit un pas pour se retirer.\\n\\n«Ah! reprit le comte, faites-moi le plaisir de demander à Pastrini s'il\\na reçu la _tavoletta_, et s'il veut m'envoyer le programme de\\nl'exécution.\\n\\n--C'est inutile, reprit Franz, tirant son calepin de sa poche; j'ai eu\\nces tablettes sous les yeux, je les ai copiées et les voici.\\n\\n--C'est bien; alors monsieur Bertuccio, vous pouvez vous retirer, je\\nn'ai plus besoin de vous. Qu'on nous prévienne seulement quand le\\ndéjeuner sera servi. Ces messieurs, continua-t-il en se retournant vers\\nles deux amis, me font-ils l'honneur de déjeuner avec moi?\\n\\n--Mais, en vérité, monsieur le comte, dit Albert, ce serait abuser.\\n\\n--Non pas, au contraire, vous me faites grand plaisir, vous me rendrez\\ntout cela un jour à Paris, l'un ou l'autre et peut-être tous les deux.\\nMonsieur Bertuccio, vous ferez mettre trois couverts.»\\n\\nIl prit le calepin des mains de Franz.\\n\\n«Nous disons donc, continua-t-il du ton dont il eût lu les _Petites\\nAffiches_, que «seront exécutés, aujourd'hui 22 février, le nommé Andrea\\nRondolo, coupable d'assassinat sur la personne très respectable et très\\nvénérée de don César Torlini, chanoine de l'église Saint-Jean-de-Latran,\\net le nommé Peppino, dit _Rocca Priori_, convaincu de complicité avec\\nle détestable bandit Luigi Vampa et les hommes de sa troupe...»\\n\\n--Hum! «Le premier sera _mazzolato_, le second _decapitato_.» Oui, en\\neffet, reprit le comte, c'était bien comme cela que la chose devait se\\npasser d'abord; mais je crois que depuis hier il est survenu, quelque\\nchangement dans l'ordre et la marche de la cérémonie.\\n\\n--Bah! dit Franz.\\n\\n--Oui, hier chez le cardinal Rospigliosi, où j'ai passé la soirée, il\\nétait question de quelque chose comme d'un sursis accordé à l'un des\\ndeux condamnés.\\n\\n--À Andrea Rondolo? demanda Franz.\\n\\n--Non... reprit négligemment le comte; à l'autre (il jeta un coup d'oeil\\nsur le calepin comme pour se rappeler le nom), à Peppino, dit _Rocca\\nPriori_. Cela vous prive d'une guillotinade, mais il vous reste la\\n_mazzolata_ qui est un supplice fort curieux quand on le voit pour la\\npremière fois, et même pour la seconde; tandis que l'autre, que vous\\ndevez connaître d'ailleurs, est trop simple, trop uni: il n'y a rien\\nd'inattendu. La _mandaïa_ ne se trompe pas, elle ne tremble pas, ne\\nfrappe pas à faux, ne s'y reprend pas à trente fois comme le soldat qui\\ncoupait la tête au comte de Chalais, et auquel, au reste, Richelieu\\navait peut-être recommandé le patient. Ah! Tenez, ajouta le comte d'un\\nton méprisant, ne me parlez pas des Européens pour les supplices, ils\\nn'y entendent rien et en sont véritablement à l'enfance ou plutôt à la\\nvieillesse de la cruauté.\\n\\n--En vérité, monsieur le comte, répondit Franz, on croirait que vous\\navez fait une étude comparée des supplices chez les différents peuples\\ndu monde.\\n\\n--Il y en a peu du moins que je n'aie vus, reprit froidement le comte.\\n\\n--Et vous avez trouvé du plaisir à assister à ces horribles spectacles?\\n\\n--Mon premier sentiment a été la répulsion, le second l'indifférence, le\\ntroisième la curiosité.\\n\\n--La curiosité! le mot est terrible, savez-vous?\\n\\n--Pourquoi? Il n'y a guère dans la vie qu'une préoccupation grave; c'est\\nla mort, eh bien! n'est-il pas curieux d'étudier de quelles façons\\ndifférentes l'âme peut sortir du corps, et comment, selon les\\ncaractères, les tempéraments et même les moeurs du pays, les individus\\nsupportent ce suprême passage de l'être au néant? Quant à moi, je vous\\nréponds d'une chose: c'est que plus on a vu mourir, plus il devient\\nfacile de mourir: ainsi, à mon avis, la mort est peut-être un supplice,\\nmais n'est pas une expiation.\\n\\n--Je ne vous comprends pas bien, dit Franz; expliquez-vous, car je ne\\npuis vous dire à quel point ce que vous me dites là pique ma curiosité.\\n\\n--Écoutez, dit le comte; et son visage s'infiltra de fiel, comme le\\nvisage d'un autre se colore de sang. Si un homme eût fait périr, par des\\ntortures inouïes, au milieu des tourments sans fin, votre père, votre\\nmère, votre maîtresse, un de ces êtres enfin qui, lorsqu'on les déracine\\nde votre coeur, y laissent un vide éternel et une plaie toujours\\nsanglante, croiriez-vous la réparation que vous accorde la société\\nsuffisante, parce que le fer de la guillotine a passé entre la base de\\nl'occipital et les muscles trapèzes du meurtrier, et parce que celui qui\\nvous a fait ressentir des années de souffrances morales, a éprouvé\\nquelques secondes de douleurs physiques?\\n\\n--Oui, je le sais, reprit Franz, la justice humaine est insuffisante\\ncomme consolatrice: elle peut verser le sang en échange du sang, voilà\\ntout; il faut lui demander ce qu'elle peut et pas autre chose.\\n\\n--Et encore je vous pose là un cas matériel, reprit le comte, celui où\\nla société, attaquée par la mort d'un individu dans la base sur laquelle\\nelle repose, venge la mort par la mort; mais n'y a-t-il pas des millions\\nde douleurs dont les entrailles de l'homme peuvent être déchirées sans\\nque la société s'en occupe le moins du monde sans qu'elle lui offre le\\nmoyen insuffisant de vengeance dont nous parlions tout à l'heure? N'y\\na-t-il pas des crimes pour lesquels le pal des Turcs, les auges des\\nPersans, les nerfs roulés des Iroquois seraient des supplices trop doux,\\net que cependant la société indifférente laisse sans châtiment?...\\nRépondez, n'y a-t-il pas de ces crimes?\\n\\n--Oui, reprit Franz, et c'est pour les punir que le duel est toléré.\\n\\n--Ah! le duel, s'écria le comte, plaisante manière, sur mon âme,\\nd'arriver à son but, quand le but est la vengeance! Un homme vous a\\nenlevé votre maîtresse, un homme a séduit votre femme, un homme a\\ndéshonoré votre fille; d'une vie tout entière, qui avait le droit\\nd'attendre de Dieu la part de bonheur qu'il a promise à tout être humain\\nen le créant, il a fait une existence de douleur, de misère ou\\nd'infamie, et vous vous croyez vengé parce qu'à cet homme, qui vous a\\nmis le délire dans l'esprit et le désespoir dans le coeur, vous avez\\ndonné un coup d'épée dans la poitrine ou logé une balle dans la tête?\\nAllons donc! Sans compter que c'est lui qui souvent sort triomphant de\\nla lutte, lavé aux yeux du monde et en quelque sorte absous par Dieu.\\nNon, non, continua le comte, si j'avais jamais à me venger, ce n'est pas\\nainsi que je me vengerais.\\n\\n--Ainsi, vous désapprouvez le duel? ainsi vous ne vous battriez pas en\\nduel? demanda à son tour Albert, étonné d'entendre émettre une si\\nétrange théorie.\\n\\n--Oh! si fait! dit le comte. Entendons-nous: je me battrais en duel pour\\nune misère, pour une insulte, pour un démenti, pour un soufflet, et cela\\navec d'autant plus d'insouciance que, grâce à l'adresse que j'ai acquise\\nà tous les exercices du corps et à la lente habitude que j'ai prise du\\ndanger, je serais à peu près sûr de tuer mon homme. Oh! si fait! je me\\nbattrais en duel pour tout cela; mais pour une douleur lente, profonde,\\ninfinie, éternelle, je rendrais, s'il était possible, une douleur\\npareille à celle que l'on m'aurait faite: oeil pour oeil, dent pour\\ndent, comme disent les Orientaux, nos maîtres en toutes choses, ces élus\\nde la création qui ont su se faire une vie de rêves et un paradis de\\nréalités.\\n\\n--Mais, dit Franz au comte, avec cette théorie qui vous constitue juge\\net bourreau dans votre propre cause, il est difficile que vous vous\\nteniez dans une mesure où vous échappiez éternellement vous-même à la\\npuissance de la loi. La haine est aveugle, la colère étourdie, et celui\\nqui se verse la vengeance risque de boire un breuvage amer.\\n\\n--Oui, s'il est pauvre et maladroit, non, s'il est millionnaire et\\nhabile. D'ailleurs le pis-aller pour lui est ce dernier supplice dont\\nnous parlions tout à l'heure, celui que la philanthropique révolution\\nfrançaise a substitué à l'écartèlement et à la roue. Eh bien! qu'est-ce\\nque le supplice, s'il s'est vengé? En vérité, je suis presque fâché que,\\nselon toute probabilité, ce misérable Peppino ne soit pas _decapitato_,\\ncomme ils disent, vous verriez le temps que cela dure, et si c'est\\nvéritablement la peine d'en parler. Mais, d'honneur, messieurs, nous\\navons là une singulière conversation pour un jour de carnaval. Comment\\ndonc cela est-il venu? Ah! je me le rappelle! vous m'avez demandé une\\nplace à ma fenêtre; eh bien, soit, vous l'aurez; mais mettons-nous à\\ntable d'abord, car voilà qu'on vient nous annoncer que nous sommes\\nservis.»\\n\\nEn effet, un domestique ouvrit une des quatre portes du salon et fit\\nentendre les paroles sacramentelles:\\n\\n«_Al suo commodo_!»\\n\\nLes deux jeunes gens se levèrent et passèrent dans la salle à manger.\\n\\nPendant le déjeuner, qui était excellent et servi avec une recherche\\ninfinie, Franz chercha des yeux le regard d'Albert, afin d'y lire\\nl'impression qu'il ne doutait pas qu'eussent produite en lui les paroles\\nde leur hôte; mais, soit que dans son insouciance habituelle il ne leur\\neût pas prêté une grande attention, soit que la concession que le comte\\nde Monte-Cristo lui avait faite à l'endroit du duel l'eût raccommodé\\navec lui, soit enfin que les antécédents que nous avons racontés, connus\\nde Franz seul, eussent doublé pour lui seul l'effet des théories du\\ncomte, il ne s'aperçut pas que son compagnon fût préoccupé le moins du\\nmonde; tout au contraire, il faisait honneur au repas en homme condamné\\ndepuis quatre ou cinq mois à la cuisine italienne, c'est-à-dire l'une\\ndes plus mauvaises cuisines du monde. Quant au comte, il effleurait à\\npeine chaque plat; on eût dit qu'en se mettant à table avec ses convives\\nil accomplissait un simple devoir de politesse, et qu'il attendait leur\\ndépart pour se faire servir quelque mets étrange ou particulier.\\n\\nCela rappelait malgré lui à Franz l'effroi que le comte avait inspiré à\\nla comtesse G..., et la conviction où il l'avait laissée que le comte,\\nl'homme qu'il lui avait montré dans la loge en face d'elle, était un\\nvampire.\\n\\nÀ la fin du déjeuner, Franz tira sa montre.\\n\\n«Eh bien, lui dit le comte, que faites-vous donc?\\n\\n--Vous nous excuserez, monsieur le comte, répondit Franz, mais nous\\navons encore mille choses à faire.\\n\\n--Lesquelles?\\n\\n--Nous n'avons pas de déguisements, et aujourd'hui le déguisement est de\\nrigueur.\\n\\n--Ne vous occupez donc pas de cela. Nous avons à ce que je crois, place\\ndel Popolo, une chambre particulière; j'y ferai porter les costumes que\\nvous voudrez bien m'indiquer, et nous nous masquerons séance tenante.\\n\\n--Après l'exécution? s'écria Franz.\\n\\n--Sans doute, après, pendant ou avant, comme vous voudrez.\\n\\n--En face de l'échafaud?\\n\\n--L'échafaud fait partie de la fête.\\n\\n--Tenez, monsieur le comte, j'ai réfléchi, dit Franz; décidément je vous\\nremercie de votre obligeance, mais je me contenterai d'accepter une\\nplace dans votre voiture, une place à la fenêtre du palais Rospoli, et\\nje vous laisserai libre de disposer de ma place à la fenêtre de la\\npiazza del Popolo.\\n\\n--Mais vous perdez, je vous en préviens, une chose fort curieuse,\\nrépondit le comte.\\n\\n--Vous me le raconterez, reprit Franz, et je suis convaincu que dans\\nvotre bouche le récit m'impressionnera presque autant que la vue\\npourrait le faire. D'ailleurs, plus d'une fois déjà j'ai voulu prendre\\nsur moi d'assister à une exécution, et je n'ai jamais pu m'y décider; et\\nvous, Albert?\\n\\n--Moi, répondit le vicomte, j'ai vu exécuter Castaing; mais je crois\\nque j'étais un peu gris ce jour-là. C'était le jour de ma sortie du\\ncollège, et nous avions passé la nuit je ne sais à quel cabaret.\\n\\n--D'ailleurs, ce n'est pas une raison, parce que vous n'avez pas fait\\nune chose à Paris, pour que vous ne la fassiez pas à l'étranger: quand\\non voyage, c'est pour s'instruire; quand on change de lieu, c'est pour\\nvoir. Songez donc quelle figure vous ferez quand on vous demandera:\\nComment exécute-t-on à Rome? et que vous répondrez: Je ne sais pas. Et\\npuis, on dit que le condamné est un infâme coquin, un drôle qui a tué à\\ncoups de chenet un bon chanoine qui l'avait élevé comme son fils. Que\\ndiable! quand on tue un homme d'Église, on prend une arme plus\\nconvenable qu'un chenet, surtout quand cet homme d'église est peut-être\\nnotre père. Si vous voyagiez en Espagne, vous iriez voir les combats de\\ntaureaux, n'est-ce pas? Eh bien, supposez que c'est un combat que nous\\nallons voir; souvenez-vous des anciens Romains du Cirque, des chasses où\\nl'on tuait trois cents lions et une centaine d'hommes. Souvenez-vous\\ndonc de ces quatre-vingt mille spectateurs qui battaient des mains, de\\nces sages matrones qui conduisaient là leurs filles à marier, et de ces\\ncharmantes vestales aux mains blanches qui faisaient avec le pouce un\\ncharmant petit signe qui voulait dire: Allons, pas de paresse!\\nachevez-moi cet homme-là qui est aux trois quarts mort.\\n\\n--Y allez-vous, Albert? dit Franz.\\n\\n--Ma foi, oui, mon cher! J'étais comme vous mais l'éloquence du comte me\\ndécide.\\n\\n--Allons-y donc, puisque vous le voulez, dit Franz; mais en me rendant\\nplace del Popolo, je désire passer par la rue du Cours; est-ce possible,\\nmonsieur le comte?\\n\\n--À pied, oui; en voiture, non.\\n\\n--Eh bien, j'irai à pied.\\n\\n--Il est bien nécessaire que vous passiez par la rue du Cours?\\n\\n--Oui, j'ai quelque chose à y voir.\\n\\n--Eh bien, passons par la rue du Cours, nous enverrons la voiture nous\\nattendre sur la piazza del Popolo, par la strada del Babuino;\\nd'ailleurs je ne suis pas fâché non plus de passer par la rue du Cours\\npour voir si des ordres que j'ai donnés ont été exécutés.\\n\\n--Excellence, dit le domestique en ouvrant la porte, un homme vêtu en\\npénitent demande à vous parler.\\n\\n--Ah! oui, dit le comte, je sais ce que c'est. Messieurs, voulez-vous\\nrepasser au salon, vous trouverez sur la table du milieu d'excellents\\ncigares de la Havane, je vous y rejoins dans un instant.»\\n\\nLes deux jeunes gens se levèrent et sortirent par une porte, tandis que\\nle comte, après leur avoir renouvelé ses excuses, sortait par l'autre.\\nAlbert, qui était un grand amateur, et qui, depuis qu'il était en\\nItalie, ne comptait pas comme un mince sacrifice celui d'être privé des\\ncigares du café de Paris, s'approcha de la table et poussa un cri de\\njoie en apercevant de véritables puros.\\n\\n«Eh bien, lui demanda Franz, que pensez-vous du comte de Monte-Cristo?\\n\\n--Ce que j'en pense! dit Albert visiblement étonné que son compagnon lui\\nfît une pareille question; je pense que c'est un homme charmant, qui\\nfait à merveille les honneurs de chez lui, qui a beaucoup vu, beaucoup\\nétudié, beaucoup réfléchi, qui est, comme Brutus, de l'école stoïque,\\net, ajouta-t-il en poussant amoureusement une bouffée de fumée qui monta\\nen spirale vers le plafond, et qui par-dessus tout cela possède\\nd'excellents cigares.»\\n\\nC'était l'opinion d'Albert sur le comte; or, comme Franz savait\\nqu'Albert avait la prétention de ne se faire une opinion sur les hommes\\net sur les choses qu'après de mûres réflexions, il ne tenta pas de rien\\nchanger à la sienne.\\n\\n«Mais, dit-il, avez-vous remarqué une chose singulière?\\n\\n--Laquelle?\\n\\n--L'attention avec laquelle il vous regardait.\\n\\n--Moi?\\n\\n--Oui, vous.»\\n\\nAlbert réfléchit.\\n\\n«Ah! dit-il en poussant un soupir, rien d'étonnant à cela. Je suis\\ndepuis près d'un an absent de Paris, je dois avoir des habits de l'autre\\nmonde. Le comte m'aura pris pour un provincial; détrompez-le, cher ami,\\net dites-lui, je vous prie, à la première occasion, qu'il n'en est\\nrien.»\\n\\nFranz sourit; un instant après le comte rentra.\\n\\n«Me voici, messieurs, dit-il, et tout à vous, les ordres sont donnés; la\\nvoiture va de son côté place del Popolo, et nous allons nous y rendre\\ndu nôtre, si vous voulez bien, par la rue du Cours. Prenez donc\\nquelques-uns de ces cigares, monsieur de Morcerf.\\n\\n--Ma foi, avec grand plaisir, dit Albert, car vos cigares italiens sont\\nencore pires que ceux de la régie. Quand vous viendrez à Paris, je vous\\nrendrai tout cela.\\n\\n--Ce n'est pas de refus; je compte y aller quelque jour, et, puisque\\nvous le permettez, j'irai frapper à votre porte. Allons, messieurs,\\nallons, nous n'avons pas de temps à perdre; il est midi et demi,\\npartons.»\\n\\nTous trois descendirent. Alors le cocher prit les derniers ordres de son\\nmaître, et suivit la via del Babuino, tandis que les piétons remontaient\\npar la place d'Espagne et par la via Frattina, qui les conduisait tout\\ndroit entre le palais Fiano et le palais Rospoli.\\n\\nTous les regards de Franz furent pour les fenêtres de ce dernier palais,\\nil n'avait pas oublié le signal convenu dans le Colisée entre l'homme au\\nmanteau et le Transtévère.\\n\\n«Quelles sont vos fenêtres? demanda-t-il au comte du ton le plus naturel\\nqu'il pût prendre.\\n\\n--Les trois dernières», répondit-il avec une négligence qui n'avait rien\\nd'affecté; car il ne pouvait deviner dans quel but cette question lui\\nétait faite.\\n\\nLes yeux de Franz se portèrent rapidement sur les trois fenêtres. Les\\nfenêtres latérales étaient tendues en damas jaune, et celle du milieu en\\ndamas blanc avec une croix rouge.\\n\\nL'homme au manteau avait tenu sa parole au Transtévère, et il n'y avait\\nplus de doute: l'homme au manteau, c'était bien le comte.\\n\\nLes trois fenêtres étaient encore vides.\\n\\nAu reste, de tous côtés se faisaient les préparatifs; on plaçait des\\nchaises, on dressait des échafaudages, on tendait des fenêtres. Les\\nmasques ne pouvaient paraître, les voitures ne pouvaient circuler qu'au\\nson de la cloche; mais on sentait les masques derrière toutes les\\nfenêtres, les voitures derrière toutes les portes.\\n\\nFranz, Albert et le comte continuèrent de descendre la rue du Cours. À\\nmesure qu'ils approchaient de la place du Peuple, la foule devenait plus\\népaisse et au-dessus des têtes de cette foule, on voyait s'élever deux\\nchoses: l'obélisque surmonté d'une croix qui indique le centre de la\\nplace, et, en avant de l'obélisque, juste au point de correspondance\\nvisuelle des trois rues del Babuino, del Corso et di Ripetta, les deux\\npoutres suprêmes de l'échafaud, entre lesquelles brillait le fer arrondi\\nde la mandaïa.\\n\\nÀ l'angle de la rue on trouva l'intendant du comte, qui attendait son\\nmaître.\\n\\nLa fenêtre louée à ce prix exorbitant sans doute dont le comte n'avait\\npoint voulu faire part à ses invités, appartenait au second étage du\\ngrand palais, situé entre la rue del Babuino et le monte Pincio;\\nc'était, comme nous l'avons dit, une espèce de cabinet de toilette\\ndonnant dans une chambre à coucher; en fermant la porte de la chambre à\\ncoucher, les locataires du cabinet étaient chez eux; sur les chaises on\\navait déposé des costumes de paillasse en satin blanc et bleu des plus\\nélégants.\\n\\n«Comme vous m'avez laissé le choix des costumes, dit le comte aux deux\\namis, je vous ai fait préparer ceux-ci. D'abord, c'est ce qu'il y aura\\nde mieux porté cette année; ensuite, c'est ce qu'il y a de plus commode\\npour les confettis, attendu que la farine n'y paraît pas.»\\n\\nFranz n'entendit que fort imparfaitement les paroles du comte, et il\\nn'apprécia peut-être pas à sa valeur cette nouvelle gracieuseté; car\\ntoute son attention était attirée par le spectacle que présentait la\\npiazza del Popolo, et par l'instrument terrible qui en faisait à cette\\nheure le principal ornement.\\n\\nC'était la première fois que Franz apercevait une guillotine; nous\\ndisons guillotine, car la mandaïa romaine est taillée à peu près sur le\\nmême patron que notre instrument de mort. Le couteau, qui a la forme\\nd'un croissant qui couperait par la partie convexe, tombe de moins haut,\\nvoilà tout.\\n\\nDeux hommes, assis sur la planche à bascule où l'on couche le condamné,\\ndéjeunaient en attendant, et mangeaient, autant que Franz pût le voir,\\ndu pain et des saucisses; l'un d'eux souleva la planche, en tira un\\nflacon de vin, but un coup et passa le flacon à son camarade; ces deux\\nhommes, c'étaient les aides du bourreau!\\n\\nÀ ce seul aspect, Franz avait senti la sueur poindre à la racine de ses\\ncheveux.\\n\\nLes condamnés, transportés la veille au soir des Carceri Nuove dans la\\npetite église Sainte-Marie-del-Popolo, avaient passé la nuit, assistés\\nchacun de deux prêtres, dans une chapelle ardente fermée d'une grille,\\ndevant laquelle se promenaient des sentinelles relevées d'heure en\\nheure.\\n\\nUne double haie de carabiniers placés de chaque côté de la porte de\\nl'église s'étendait jusqu'à l'échafaud, autour duquel elle\\ns'arrondissait, laissant libre un chemin de dix pieds de large à peu\\nprès, et autour de la guillotine un espace d'une centaine de pas de\\ncirconférence. Tout le reste de la place était pavé de têtes d'hommes et\\nde femmes. Beaucoup de femmes tenaient leurs enfants sur leurs épaules.\\nCes enfants, qui dépassaient la foule de tout le torse, étaient\\nadmirablement placés.\\n\\nLe monte Pincio semblait un vaste amphithéâtre dont tous les gradins\\neussent été chargés de spectateurs; les balcons des deux églises qui\\nfont l'angle de la rue del Babuino et de la rue di Ripetta regorgeaient\\nde curieux privilégiés; les marches des péristyles semblaient un flot\\nmouvant et bariolé qu'une marée incessante poussait vers le portique:\\nchaque aspérité de la muraille qui pouvait donner place à un homme avait\\nsa statue vivante.\\n\\nCe que disait le comte est donc vrai, ce qu'il y a de plus curieux dans\\nla vie est le spectacle de la mort.\\n\\nEt cependant, au lieu du silence que semblait commander la solennité du\\nspectacle, un grand bruit montait de cette foule, bruit composé de\\nrires, de huées et de cris joyeux; il était évident encore, comme\\nl'avait dit le comte que cette exécution n'était rien autre chose, pour\\ntout le peuple, que le commencement du carnaval.\\n\\nTout à coup ce bruit cessa comme par enchantement, la porte de l'église\\nvenait de s'ouvrir.\\n\\nUne confrérie de pénitents, dont chaque membre était vêtu d'un sac gris\\npercé aux yeux seulement, et tenait un cierge allumé à la main, parut\\nd'abord; en tête marchait le chef de la confrérie.\\n\\nDerrière les pénitents venait un homme de haute taille. Cet homme était\\nnu, à l'exception d'un caleçon de toile au côté gauche duquel était\\nattaché un grand couteau caché dans sa gaine; il portait sur l'épaule\\ndroite une lourde masse de fer. Cet homme, c'était le bourreau.\\n\\nIl avait en outre des sandales attachées au bas de la jambe par des\\ncordes.\\n\\nDerrière le bourreau marchaient, dans l'ordre où ils devaient être\\nexécutés, d'abord Peppino et ensuite Andrea.\\n\\nChacun était accompagné de deux prêtres.\\n\\nNi l'un ni l'autre n'avait les yeux bandés.\\n\\nPeppino marchait d'un pas assez ferme; sans doute il avait eu avis de ce\\nqui se préparait pour lui.\\n\\nAndrea était soutenu sous chaque bras par un prêtre.\\n\\nTous deux baisaient de temps en temps le crucifix que leur présentait le\\nconfesseur.\\n\\nFranz sentit, rien qu'à cette vue, les jambes qui lui manquaient; il\\nregarda Albert. Il était pâle comme sa chemise, et par un mouvement\\nmachinal il jeta loin de lui son cigare, quoiqu'il ne l'eût fumé qu'à\\nmoitié.\\n\\nLe comte seul paraissait impassible. Il y avait même plus, une légère\\nteinte rouge semblait vouloir percer la pâleur livide de ses joues.\\n\\nSon nez se dilatait comme celui d'un animal féroce qui flaire le sang,\\net ses lèvres, légèrement écartées, laissaient voir ses dents blanches,\\npetites et aiguës comme celles d'un chacal.\\n\\nEt cependant, malgré tout cela, son visage avait une expression de\\ndouceur souriante que Franz ne lui avait jamais vue; ses yeux noirs\\nsurtout étaient admirables de mansuétude et de velouté.\\n\\nCependant les deux condamnés continuaient de marcher vers l'échafaud, et\\nà mesure qu'ils avançaient on pouvait distinguer les traits de leur\\nvisage. Peppino était un beau garçon de vingt-quatre à vingt-six ans, au\\nteint hâlé par le soleil, au regard libre et sauvage. Il portait la tête\\nhaute et semblait flairer le vent pour voir de quel côté lui viendrait\\nson libérateur.\\n\\nAndrea était gros et court: son visage, bassement cruel, n'indiquait pas\\nd'âge; il pouvait cependant avoir trente ans à peu près. Dans la prison,\\nil avait laissé pousser sa barbe. Sa tête retombait sur une de ses\\népaules, ses jambes pliaient sous lui: tout son être paraissait obéir à\\nun mouvement machinal dans lequel sa volonté n'était déjà plus rien.\\n\\n«Il me semble, dit Franz au comte, que vous m'avez annoncé qu'il n'y\\naurait qu'une exécution.\\n\\n--Je vous ai dit la vérité, répondit-il froidement.\\n\\n--Cependant voici deux condamnés.\\n\\n--Oui; mais de ces deux condamnés l'un touche à la mort, et l'autre a\\nencore de longues années à vivre.\\n\\n--Il me semble que si la grâce doit venir, il n'y a plus de temps à\\nperdre.\\n\\n--Aussi la voilà qui vient; regardez», dit le Comte.\\n\\nEn effet, au moment où Peppino arrivait au pied de la mandaïa, un\\npénitent, qui semblait être en retard, perça la haie sans que les\\nsoldats fissent obstacle à son passage, et, s'avançant vers le chef de\\nla confrérie, lui remit un papier plié en quatre.\\n\\nLe regard ardent de Peppino n'avait perdu aucun de ces détails; le chef\\nde la confrérie déplia le papier, le lut et leva la main.\\n\\n«Le Seigneur soit béni et Sa Sainteté soit louée! dit-il à haute et\\nintelligible voix. Il y a grâce de la vie pour l'un des condamnés.\\n\\n--Grâce! s'écria le peuple d'un seul cri; il y a grâce!»\\n\\nÀ ce mot de grâce, Andrea sembla bondir et redressa la tête.\\n\\n«Grâce pour qui?» cria-t-il.\\n\\nPeppino resta immobile, muet et haletant.\\n\\n«Il y a grâce de la peine de mort pour Peppino Rocca Priori», dit le\\nchef de la confrérie.\\n\\nEt il passa le papier au capitaine commandant les carabiniers, lequel,\\naprès l'avoir lu, le lui rendit.\\n\\n«Grâce pour Peppino! s'écria Andrea, entièrement tiré de l'état de\\ntorpeur où il semblait être plongé; pourquoi grâce pour lui et pas pour\\nmoi? nous devions mourir ensemble; on m'avait promis qu'il mourrait\\navant moi, on n'a pas le droit de me faire mourir seul, je ne le veux\\npas!»\\n\\nEt il s'arracha au bras des deux prêtres, se tordant, hurlant, rugissant\\net faisant des efforts insensés pour rompre les cordes qui lui liaient\\nles mains.\\n\\nLe bourreau fit signe à ses deux aides, qui sautèrent en bas de\\nl'échafaud et vinrent s'emparer du condamné.\\n\\n«Qu'y a-t-il donc?» demanda Franz au comte.\\n\\nCar, comme tout cela se passait en patois romain, il n'avait pas très\\nbien compris.\\n\\n«Ce qu'il y a? dit le comte, ne comprenez-vous pas bien? Il y a que\\ncette créature humaine qui va mourir est furieuse de ce que son\\nsemblable ne meure pas avec elle et que, si on la laissait faire, elle\\nle déchirerait avec ses ongles et avec ses dents plutôt que de le\\nlaisser jouir de la vie dont elle va être privée. Ô hommes! hommes! race\\nde crocodiles! comme dit Karl Moor, s'écria le comte en étendant les\\ndeux poings vers toute cette foule, que je vous reconnais bien là, et\\nqu'en tout temps vous êtes bien dignes de vous-mêmes!»\\n\\nEn effet, Andrea et les deux aides du bourreau se roulaient dans la\\npoussière, le condamné criant toujours: «Il doit mourir, je veux qu'il\\nmeure! On n'a pas le droit de me tuer tout seul!»\\n\\n«Regardez, regardez, continua le comte en saisissant chacun des deux\\njeunes gens par la main, regardez, car, sur mon âme, c'est curieux,\\nvoilà un homme qui était résigné à son sort, qui marchait à l'échafaud,\\nqui allait mourir comme un lâche, c'est vrai, mais enfin il allait\\nmourir sans résistance et sans récrimination: savez-vous ce qui lui\\ndonnait quelque force? savez-vous ce qui le consolait? savez-vous ce qui\\nlui faisait prendre son supplice en patience? c'est qu'un autre\\npartageait son angoisse; c'est qu'un autre allait mourir comme lui;\\nc'est qu'un autre allait mourir avant lui! Menez deux moutons à la\\nboucherie, deux boeufs à l'abattoir, et faites comprendre à l'un d'eux\\nque son compagnon ne mourra pas, le mouton bêlera de joie, le boeuf\\nmugira de plaisir mais l'homme, l'homme que Dieu a fait à son image,\\nl'homme à qui Dieu a imposé pour première, pour unique, pour suprême\\nloi, l'amour de son prochain, l'homme à qui Dieu a donné une voix pour\\nexprimer sa pensée, quel sera son premier cri quand il apprendra que son\\ncamarade est sauvé? un blasphème. Honneur à l'homme, ce chef-d'oeuvre de\\nla nature, ce roi de la création!»\\n\\nEt le comte éclata de rire, mais d'un rire terrible qui indiquait qu'il\\navait dû horriblement souffrir pour en arriver à rire ainsi.\\n\\nCependant la lutte continuait, et c'était quelque chose d'affreux à\\nvoir. Les deux valets portaient Andrea sur l'échafaud; tout le peuple\\navait pris parti contre lui, et vingt mille voix criaient d'un seul cri:\\n«À mort! à mort!»\\n\\nFranz se rejeta en arrière; mais le comte ressaisit son bras et le\\nretint devant la fenêtre.\\n\\n«Que faites-vous donc? lui dit-il; de la pitié? elle est, ma foi, bien\\nplacée! Si vous entendiez crier au chien enragé, vous prendriez votre\\nfusil, vous vous jetteriez dans la rue, vous tueriez sans miséricorde à\\nbout portant la pauvre bête, qui, au bout du compte ne serait coupable\\nque d'avoir été mordue par un autre chien, et de rendre ce qu'on lui a\\nfait: et voilà que vous avez pitié d'un homme qu'aucun autre homme n'a\\nmordu, et qui cependant a tué son bienfaiteur, et qui maintenant, ne\\npouvant plus tuer parce qu'il a les mains liées, veut à toute force voir\\nmourir son compagnon de captivité, son camarade d'infortune! Non, non,\\nregardez, regardez.»\\n\\nLa recommandation était devenue presque inutile, Franz était comme\\nfasciné par l'horrible spectacle. Les deux valets avaient porté le\\ncondamné sur l'échafaud, et là, malgré ses efforts, ses morsures, ses\\ncris, ils l'avaient forcé de se mettre à genoux. Pendant ce temps, le\\nbourreau s'était placé de côté et la masse en arrêt; alors, sur un\\nsigne, les deux aides s'écartèrent. Le condamné voulut se relever, mais\\navant qu'il en eût le temps, la masse s'abattit sur sa tempe gauche; on\\nentendit un bruit sourd et mat, le patient tomba comme un boeuf, la face\\ncontre terre, puis d'un contrecoup, se retourna sur le dos. Alors le\\nbourreau laissa tomber sa masse, tira le couteau de sa ceinture, d'un\\nseul coup lui ouvrit la gorge et, montant aussitôt sur son ventre, se\\nmit à le pétrir avec ses pieds.\\n\\nÀ chaque pression, un jet de sang s'élançait du cou du condamné.\\n\\nPour cette fois, Franz n'y put tenir plus longtemps; il se rejeta en\\narrière, et alla tomber sur un fauteuil à moitié évanoui.\\n\\nAlbert, les yeux fermés, resta debout, mais cramponné aux rideaux de la\\nfenêtre.\\n\\nLe comte était debout et triomphant comme le mauvais ange.\",\n",
       " 'XXXVI': \"Quand Franz revint à lui, il trouva Albert qui buvait un verre d'eau\\ndont sa pâleur indiquait qu'il avait grand besoin, et le comte qui\\npassait déjà son costume de paillasse. Il jeta machinalement les yeux\\nsur la place; tout avait disparu, échafaud, bourreaux, victimes; il ne\\nrestait plus que le peuple, bruyant, affairé, joyeux; la cloche du monte\\nCitorio, qui ne retentit que pour la mort du pape et l'ouverture de la\\nmascherata, sonnait à pleines volées.\\n\\n«Eh bien, demanda-t-il au comte, que s'est-il donc passé?\\n\\n--Rien, absolument rien, dit-il, comme vous voyez; seulement le\\ncarnaval est commencé, habillons nous vite.\\n\\n--En effet, répondit Franz au comte, il ne reste de toute cette horrible\\nscène que la trace d'un rêve.\\n\\n--C'est que ce n'est pas autre chose qu'un rêve, qu'un cauchemar, que\\nvous avez eu.\\n\\n--Oui, moi; mais le condamné?\\n\\n--C'est un rêve aussi; seulement il est resté endormi, lui, tandis que\\nvous vous êtes réveillé, vous; et qui peut dire lequel de vous deux est\\nle privilégié?\\n\\n--Mais Peppino, demanda Franz, qu'est-il devenu?\\n\\n--Peppino est un garçon de sens qui n'a pas le moindre amour-propre, et\\nqui, contre l'habitude des hommes qui sont furieux lorsqu'on ne s'occupe\\npas d'eux, a été enchanté, lui, de voir que l'attention générale se\\nportait sur son camarade; il a en conséquence profité de cette\\ndistraction pour se glisser dans la foule et disparaître, sans même\\nremercier les dignes prêtres qui l'avaient accompagné. Décidément,\\nl'homme est un animal fort ingrat et fort égoïste.... Mais\\nhabillez-vous; tenez, vous voyez que M. de Morcerf vous donne\\nl'exemple.»\\n\\nEn effet, Albert passait machinalement son pantalon de taffetas\\npar-dessus son pantalon noir et ses bottes vernies.\\n\\n«Eh bien! Albert, demanda Franz, êtes-vous bien en train de faire des\\nfolies? Voyons, répondez franchement.\\n\\n--Non, dit-il, mais en vérité je suis aise maintenant d'avoir vu une\\npareille chose, et je comprends ce que disait M. le comte: c'est que,\\nlorsqu'on a pu s'habituer une fois à un pareil spectacle, ce soit le\\nseul qui donne encore des émotions.\\n\\n--Sans compter que c'est en ce moment-là seulement qu'on peut faire des\\nétudes de caractères, dit le comte; sur la première marche de\\nl'échafaud, la mort arrache le masque qu'on a porté toute la vie, et le\\nvéritable visage apparaît. Il faut en convenir, celui d'Andrea n'était\\npas beau à voir.... Le hideux coquin!... Habillons-nous, messieurs,\\nhabillons-nous!»\\n\\nIl eût été ridicule à Franz de faire la petite maîtresse et de ne pas\\nsuivre l'exemple que lui donnaient ses deux compagnons. Il passa donc à\\nson tour son costume et mit son masque, qui n'était certainement pas\\nplus pâle que son visage.\\n\\nLa toilette achevée, on descendit. La voiture attendait à la porte,\\npleine de confetti et de bouquets.\\n\\nOn prit la file.\\n\\nIl est difficile de se faire l'idée d'une opposition plus complète que\\ncelle qui venait de s'opérer. Au lieu de ce spectacle de mort sombre et\\nsilencieux, la place del Popolo présentait l'aspect d'une folle et\\nbruyante orgie. Une foule de masques sortaient, débordant de tous les\\ncôtés, s'échappant par les portes, descendant par les fenêtres; les\\nvoitures débouchaient à tous des coins de rue, chargées de pierrots,\\nd'arlequins, de dominos, de marquis, de Transtévères, de grotesques, de\\nchevaliers, de paysans: tout cela criant, gesticulant, lançant des oeufs\\npleins de farine, des confetti, des bouquets; attaquant de la parole et\\ndu projectile amis et étrangers, connus et inconnus, sans que personne\\nait le droit de s'en fâcher, sans que pas un fasse autre chose que d'en\\nrire.\\n\\nFranz et Albert étaient comme des hommes que, pour les distraire d'un\\nviolent chagrin, on conduirait dans une orgie, et qui, à mesure qu'ils\\nboivent et qu'ils s'enivrent, sentent un voile s'épaissir entre le passé\\net le présent. Ils voyaient toujours, ou plutôt ils continuaient de\\nsentir en eux le reflet de ce qu'ils avaient vu. Mais peu à peu\\nl'ivresse générale les gagna: il leur sembla que leur raison chancelante\\nallait les abandonner; ils éprouvaient un besoin étrange de prendre leur\\npart de ce bruit, de ce mouvement, de ce vertige. Une poignée de\\nconfetti qui arriva à Morcerf d'une voiture voisine, et qui, en le\\ncouvrant de poussière, ainsi que ses deux compagnons, piqua son cou et\\ntoute la portion du visage que ne garantissait pas le masque, comme si\\non lui eût jeté un cent d'épingles, acheva de le pousser à la lutte\\ngénérale dans laquelle étaient déjà engagés tous les masques qu'ils\\nrencontraient. Il se leva à son tour dans la voiture, il puisa à pleines\\nmains dans les sacs, et, avec toute la vigueur et l'adresse dont il\\nétait capable, il envoya à son tour oeufs et dragées à ses voisins.\\n\\nDès lors, le combat était engagé. Le souvenir de ce qu'ils avaient vu\\nune demi-heure auparavant s'effaça tout à fait de l'esprit des deux\\njeunes gens, tant le spectacle bariolé, mouvant, insensé, qu'ils avaient\\nsous les yeux était venu leur faire diversion. Quant au comte de\\nMonte-Cristo, il n'avait jamais, comme nous l'avons dit, paru\\nimpressionné un seul instant.\\n\\nEn effet, qu'on se figure cette grande et belle rue du Cours, bordée\\nd'un bout à l'autre de palais à quatre ou cinq étages avec tous leurs\\nbalcons garnis de tapisseries, avec toutes leurs fenêtres drapées; à ces\\nbalcons et à ces fenêtres, trois cent mille spectateurs, Romains,\\nItaliens, étrangers venus des quatre parties du monde: toutes les\\naristocraties réunies, aristocraties de naissance, d'argent, de génie;\\ndes femmes charmantes, qui, subissant elles-mêmes l'influence de ce\\nspectacle, se courbent sur les balcons, se penchent hors des fenêtres,\\nfont pleuvoir sur les voitures qui passent une grêle de confetti qu'on\\nleur rend en bouquets; l'atmosphère tout épaissie de dragées qui\\ndescendent et de fleurs qui montent; puis sur le pavé des rues une foule\\njoyeuse, incessante; folle, avec des costumes insensés: des choux\\ngigantesques qui se promènent, des têtes de buffles qui mugissent sur\\ndes corps d'hommes, des chiens qui semblent marcher sur les pieds de\\nderrière; au milieu de tout cela un masque qui se soulève, et, dans\\ncette tentation de saint Antoine rêvée par Callot, quelque Astarté qui\\nmontre une ravissante figure qu'on veut suivre et de laquelle on est\\nséparé par des espèces de démons pareils à ceux qu'on voit dans ses\\nrêves, et l'on aura une faible idée de ce qu'est le carnaval de Rome.\\n\\nAu second tour le comte fit arrêter la voiture et demanda à ses\\ncompagnons la permission de les quitter, laissant sa voiture à leur\\ndisposition. Franz leva les yeux: on était en face du palais Rospoli; et\\nà la fenêtre du milieu, à celle qui était drapée d'une pièce de damas\\nblanc avec une croix rouge était un domino bleu, sous lequel\\nl'imagination de Franz se représenta sans peine la belle Grecque du\\nthéâtre Argentina.\\n\\n«Messieurs, dit le comte en sautant à terre, quand vous serez las d'être\\nacteurs et que vous voudrez redevenir spectateurs, vous savez que vous\\navez place à mes fenêtres. En attendant, disposez de mon cocher, de ma\\nvoiture et de mes domestiques.»\\n\\nNous avons oublié de dire que le cocher du comte était gravement vêtu\\nd'une peau d'ours noir, exactement pareille à celle d'Odry dans _l'Ours\\net le Pacha_, et que les deux laquais qui se tenaient debout derrière la\\ncalèche possédaient des costumes de singe vert, parfaitement adaptés à\\nleurs tailles, et des masques à ressorts avec lesquels ils faisaient la\\ngrimace aux passants.\\n\\nFranz remercia le comte de son offre obligeante: quant à Albert, il\\nétait en coquetterie avec une pleine voiture de paysannes romaines,\\narrêtée, comme celle du comte, par un de ces repos si communs dans les\\nfiles et qu'il écrasait de bouquets.\\n\\nMalheureusement pour lui la file reprit son mouvement, et tandis qu'il\\ndescendait vers la place del Popolo, la voiture qui avait attiré son\\nattention remontait vers le palais de Venise.\\n\\n«Ah! mon cher! dit-il à Franz, vous n'avez pas vu?...\\n\\n--Quoi? demanda Franz.\\n\\n--Tenez, cette calèche qui s'en va toute chargée de paysannes romaines.\\n\\n--Non.\\n\\n--Eh bien, je suis sûr que ce sont des femmes charmantes.\\n\\n--Quel malheur que vous soyez masqué, mon cher Albert, dit Franz,\\nc'était le moment de vous rattraper de vos désappointements amoureux!\\n\\n--Oh! répondit-il moitié riant, moitié convaincu, j'espère bien que le\\ncarnaval ne se passera pas sans m'apporter quelque dédommagement.»\\n\\nMalgré cette espérance d'Albert, toute la journée se passa sans autre\\naventure que la rencontre, deux ou trois fois renouvelée, de la calèche\\naux paysannes romaines. À l'une de ces rencontres, soit hasard, soit\\ncalcul d'Albert, son masque se détacha.\\n\\nÀ cette rencontre, il prit le reste du bouquet et le jeta dans la\\ncalèche.\\n\\nSans doute une des femmes charmantes qu'Albert devinait sous le costume\\ncoquet de paysannes fut touchée de cette galanterie, car à son tour,\\nlorsque la voiture des deux amis repassa, elle y jeta un bouquet de\\nviolettes.\\n\\nAlbert se précipita sur le bouquet. Comme Franz n'avait aucun motif de\\ncroire qu'il était à son adresse, il laissa Albert s'en emparer. Albert\\nle mit victorieusement à sa boutonnière, et la voiture continua sa\\ncourse triomphante.\\n\\n«Eh bien, lui dit Franz, voilà un commencement d'aventure!\\n\\n--Riez tant que vous voudrez, répondit-il, mais en vérité je crois que\\noui; aussi je ne quitte plus ce bouquet.\\n\\n--Pardieu, je crois bien! dit Franz en riant, c'est un signe de\\nreconnaissance.»\\n\\nLa plaisanterie, au reste, prit bientôt un caractère de réalité, car\\nlorsque, toujours conduits par la file, Franz et Albert croisèrent de\\nnouveau la voiture des _contadine_, celle qui avait jeté le bouquet à\\nAlbert battit des mains en le voyant à sa boutonnière.\\n\\n«Bravo, mon cher! bravo! lui dit Franz, voilà qui se prépare à\\nmerveille! Voulez-vous que je vous quitte et vous est-il plus agréable\\nd'être seul?\\n\\n--Non, dit-il, ne brusquons rien; je ne veux pas me laisser prendre\\ncomme un sot à une première démonstration, à un rendez-vous sous\\nl'horloge comme nous disons pour le bal de l'Opéra. Si la belle\\npaysanne a envie d'aller plus loin, nous la retrouvons demain ou plutôt\\nelle nous retrouvera. Alors elle me donnera signe d'existence, et je\\nverrai ce que j'aurai à faire.\\n\\n--En vérité, mon cher Albert, dit Franz, vous êtes sage comme Nestor et\\nprudent comme Ulysse; et si votre Circé parvient à vous changer en une\\nbête quelconque, il faudra qu'elle soit bien adroite ou bien puissante.»\\n\\nAlbert avait raison. La belle inconnue avait résolu sans doute de ne pas\\npousser plus loin l'intrigue ce jour-là; car, quoique les jeunes gens\\nfissent encore plusieurs tours, ils ne revirent pas la calèche qu'ils\\ncherchaient des yeux: elle avait disparu sans doute par une des rues\\nadjacentes.\\n\\nAlors ils revinrent au palais Rospoli, mais le comte aussi avait\\ndisparu avec le domino bleu. Les deux fenêtres tendues en damas jaune\\ncontinuaient, au reste, d'être occupées par des personnes qu'il avait\\nsans doute invitées.\\n\\nEn ce moment, la même cloche qui avait sonné l'ouverture de la\\nmascherata sonna la retraite. La file du Corso se rompit aussitôt, et en\\nun instant toutes les voitures disparurent dans les rues transversales.\\n\\nFranz et Albert étaient en ce moment en face de la via delle Maratte.\\n\\nLe cocher l'enfila sans rien dire, et, gagnant la place d'Espagne en\\nlongeant le palais Poli, il s'arrêta devant l'hôtel.\\n\\nMaître Pastrini vint recevoir ses hôtes sur le seuil de la porte.\\n\\nLe premier soin de Franz fut de s'informer du comte et d'exprimer le\\nregret de ne l'avoir pas repris à temps, mais Pastrini le rassura en lui\\ndisant que le comte de Monte-Cristo avait commandé une seconde voiture\\npour lui, et que cette voiture était allée le chercher à quatre heures\\nau palais Rospoli. Il était en outre chargé, de sa part, d'offrir aux\\ndeux amis la clef de sa loge au théâtre Argentina.\\n\\nFranz interrogea Albert sur ses dispositions, mais Albert avait de\\ngrands projets à mettre à exécution avant de penser à aller au théâtre;\\nen conséquence, au lieu de répondre, il s'informa si maître Pastrini\\npourrait lui procurer un tailleur.\\n\\n«Un tailleur, demanda notre hôte, et pour quoi faire?\\n\\n--Pour nous faire d'ici à demain des habits de paysans romains, aussi\\nélégants que possible», dit Albert.\\n\\nMaître Pastrini secoua la tête.\\n\\n«Vous faire d'ici à demain deux habits! s'écria-t-il, voilà bien, j'en\\ndemande pardon à Vos Excellences, une demande à la française; deux\\nhabits! quand d'ici à huit jours vous ne trouveriez certainement pas un\\ntailleur qui consentît à coudre six boutons à un gilet, lui\\npayassiez-vous ces boutons un écu la pièce!\\n\\n--Alors il faut donc renoncer à se procurer les habits que je désire?\\n\\n--Non, parce que nous aurons ces habits tout faits. Laissez-moi\\nm'occuper de cela, et demain vous trouverez en vous éveillant une\\ncollection de chapeaux, de vestes et de culottes dont vous serez\\nsatisfaits.\\n\\n--Mon cher, dit Franz à Albert, rapportons-nous-en à notre hôte, il nous\\na déjà prouvé qu'il était homme de ressources; dînons donc\\ntranquillement, et après le dîner allons voir _l'Italienne à Alger_.\\n\\n--Va pour l'_Italienne à Alger_, dit Albert; mais songez, maître\\nPastrini, que moi et monsieur, continua-t-il en désignant Franz, nous\\nmettons la plus haute importance à avoir demain les habits que nous vous\\navons demandés.»\\n\\nL'aubergiste affirma une dernière fois à ses hôtes qu'ils n'avaient à\\ns'inquiéter de rien et qu'ils seraient servis à leurs souhaits; sur quoi\\nFranz et Albert remontèrent pour se débarrasser de leurs costumes de\\npaillasses.\\n\\nAlbert, en dépouillant le sien, serra avec le plus grand soin son\\nbouquet de violettes: c'était son signe de reconnaissance pour le\\nlendemain.\\n\\nLes deux amis se mirent à table; mais, tout en dînant, Albert ne put\\ns'empêcher de remarquer la différence notable qui existait entre les\\nmérites respectifs du cuisinier de maître Pastrini et celui du comte de\\nMonte-Cristo. Or, la vérité força Franz d'avouer, malgré les préventions\\nqu'il paraissait avoir contre le comte, que le parallèle n'était point à\\nl'avantage du chef de maître Pastrini.\\n\\nAu dessert, le domestique s'informa de l'heure à laquelle les jeunes\\ngens désiraient la voiture. Albert et Franz se regardèrent, craignant\\nvéritablement d'être indiscrets. Le domestique les comprit.\\n\\n«Son Excellence le comte de Monte-Cristo, leur dit-il, a donné des\\nordres positifs pour que la voiture demeurât toute la journée aux ordres\\nde Leurs Seigneuries; Leurs Seigneuries peuvent donc disposer sans\\ncrainte d'être indiscrètes.»\\n\\nLes jeunes gens résolurent de profiter jusqu'au bout de la courtoisie du\\ncomte, et ordonnèrent d'atteler, tandis qu'ils allaient substituer une\\ntoilette du soir à leur toilette de la journée, tant soit peu froissée\\npar les combats nombreux auxquels ils s'étaient livrés.\\n\\nCette précaution prise, ils se rendirent au théâtre Argentina, et\\ns'installèrent dans la loge du comte.\\n\\nPendant le premier acte, la comtesse G... entra dans la sienne; son\\npremier regard se dirigea du côté où la veille elle avait vu le comte,\\nde sorte qu'elle aperçut Franz et Albert dans la loge de celui sur le\\ncompte duquel elle avait exprimé, il y avait vingt-quatre heures, à\\nFranz, une si étrange opinion.\\n\\nSa lorgnette était dirigée sur lui avec un tel acharnement, que Franz\\nvit bien qu'il y aurait de la cruauté à tarder plus longtemps de\\nsatisfaire sa curiosité; aussi, usant du privilège accordé aux\\nspectateurs des théâtres italiens, qui consiste à faire des salles de\\nspectacle leurs salons de réception, les deux amis quittèrent-ils leur\\nloge pour aller présenter leurs hommages à la comtesse.\\n\\nÀ peine furent-ils entrés dans sa loge qu'elle fit signe à Franz de se\\nmettre à la place d'honneur.\\n\\nAlbert, à son tour, se plaça derrière.\\n\\n«Eh bien, dit-elle, donnant à peine à Franz le temps de s'asseoir, il\\nparaît que vous n'avez rien eu de plus pressé que de faire connaissance\\navec le nouveau Lord Ruthwen, et que vous voilà les meilleurs amis du\\nmonde?\\n\\n--Sans que nous soyons si avancés que vous le dites dans une intimité\\nréciproque, je ne puis nier, madame la comtesse, répondit Franz, que\\nnous n'ayons toute la journée abusé de son obligeance.\\n\\n--Comment, toute la journée?\\n\\n--Ma foi, c'est le mot: ce matin nous avons accepté son déjeuner,\\npendant toute la mascherata nous avons couru le Corso dans sa voiture,\\nenfin ce soir nous venons au spectacle dans sa loge.\\n\\n--Vous le connaissez donc?\\n\\n--Oui et non.\\n\\n--Comment cela?\\n\\n--C'est toute une longue histoire.\\n\\n--Que vous me raconterez?\\n\\n--Elle vous ferait trop peur.\\n\\n--Raison de plus.\\n\\n--Attendez au moins que cette histoire ait un dénouement.\\n\\n--Soit, j'aime les histoires complètes. En attendant, comment vous\\nêtes-vous trouvés en contact? qui vous a présentés à lui?\\n\\n--Personne; c'est lui au contraire qui s'est fait présenter à nous.\\n\\n--Quand cela?\\n\\n--Hier soir, en vous quittant.\\n\\n--Par quel intermédiaire?\\n\\n--Oh! mon Dieu! par l'intermédiaire très prosaïque de notre hôte!\\n\\n--Il loge donc hôtel d'Espagne, comme vous?\\n\\n--Non seulement dans le même hôtel, mais sur le même carré.\\n\\n--Comment s'appelle-t-il? car sans doute vous savez son nom?\\n\\n--Parfaitement, le comte de Monte-Cristo.\\n\\n--Qu'est-ce que ce nom-là? ce n'est pas un nom de race.\\n\\n--Non, c'est le nom d'une île qu'il a achetée.\\n\\n--Et il est comte?\\n\\n--Comte toscan.\\n\\n--Enfin, nous avalerons celui-là avec les autres, reprit la comtesse,\\nqui était d'une des plus vieilles familles des environs de Venise; et\\nquel homme est-ce d'ailleurs?\\n\\n--Demandez au vicomte de Morcerf.\\n\\n--Vous entendez, monsieur, on me renvoie à vous, dit la comtesse.\\n\\n--Nous serions difficiles si nous ne le trouvions pas charmant, madame,\\nrépondit Albert; un ami de dix ans n'eût pas fait pour nous plus qu'il\\nn'a fait, et cela avec une grâce, une délicatesse, une courtoisie qui\\nindiquent véritablement un homme du monde.\\n\\n--Allons, dit la comtesse en riant, vous verrez que mon vampire sera\\ntout bonnement quelque nouvel enrichi qui veut se faire pardonner ses\\nmillions, et qui aura pris le regard de Lara pour qu'on ne le confonde\\npas avec M. de Rothschild. Et elle, l'avez-vous vue?\\n\\n--Qui elle? demanda Franz en souriant.\\n\\n--La belle Grecque d'hier.\\n\\n--Non. Nous avons, je crois bien, entendu le son de sa guzla, mais elle\\nest restée parfaitement invisible.\\n\\n--C'est-à-dire, quand vous dites invisible, mon cher Franz, dit Albert,\\nc'est tout bonnement pour faire du mystérieux. Pour qui prenez-vous donc\\nce domino bleu qui était à la fenêtre tendue de damas blanc?\\n\\n--Et où était cette fenêtre tendue de damas blanc? demanda la comtesse.\\n\\n--Au palais Rospoli.\\n\\n--Le comte avait donc trois fenêtres au palais Rospoli?\\n\\n--Oui. Êtes-vous passée rue du Cours?\\n\\n--Sans doute.\\n\\n--Eh bien, avez-vous remarqué deux fenêtres tendues de damas jaune et\\nune fenêtre tendue de damas blanc avec une croix rouge? Ces trois\\nfenêtres étaient au comte.\\n\\n--Ah çà! mais c'est donc un nabab que cet homme? Savez-vous ce que\\nvalent trois fenêtres comme celles-là pour huit jours de carnaval, et au\\npalais Rospoli, c'est-à-dire dans la plus belle situation du Corso?\\n\\n--Deux ou trois cents écus romains.\\n\\n--Dites deux ou trois mille.\\n\\n--Ah, diable.\\n\\n--Et est-ce son île qui lui fait ce beau revenu?\\n\\n--Son île? elle ne rapporte pas un bajocco.\\n\\n--Pourquoi l'a-t-il achetée alors?\\n\\n--Par fantaisie.\\n\\n--C'est donc un original?\\n\\n--Le fait est, dit Albert, qu'il m'a paru assez excentrique. S'il\\nhabitait Paris, s'il fréquentait nos spectacles, je vous dirais, mon\\ncher, ou que c'est un mauvais plaisant qui pose, ou que c'est un pauvre\\ndiable que la littérature a perdu; en vérité, il a fait ce matin deux ou\\ntrois sorties dignes de Didier ou d'Antony.»\\n\\nEn ce moment une visite entra, et, selon l'usage, Franz céda sa place au\\nnouveau venu; cette circonstance, outre le déplacement, eut encore pour\\nrésultat de changer le sujet de la conversation.\\n\\nUne heure après, les deux amis rentraient à l'hôtel. Maître Pastrini\\ns'était déjà occupé de leurs déguisements du lendemain et il leur promit\\nqu'ils seraient satisfaits de son intelligente activité.\\n\\nEn effet, le lendemain à neuf heures il entrait dans la chambre de\\nFranz avec un tailleur chargé de huit ou dix costumes de paysans\\nromains. Les deux amis en choisirent deux pareils, qui allaient à peu\\nprès leur taille, et chargèrent leur hôte de leur faire coudre une\\nvingtaine de mètres de rubans à chacun de leurs chapeaux, et de leur\\nprocurer deux de ces charmantes écharpes de soie aux bandes\\ntransversales et aux vives couleurs dont les hommes du peuple, dans les\\njours de fête, ont l'habitude de se serrer la taille.\\n\\nAlbert avait hâte de voir comment son nouvel habit lui irait: c'était\\nune veste et une culotte de velours bleu, des bas à coins brodés, des\\nsouliers à boucles et un gilet de soie. Albert ne pouvait, au reste, que\\ngagner à ce costume pittoresque; et lorsque sa ceinture eut serré sa\\ntaille élégante, lorsque son chapeau légèrement incliné de côté, laissa\\ntomber sur son épaule des flots de rubans, Franz fut forcé d'avouer que\\nle costume est souvent pour beaucoup dans la supériorité physique que\\nnous accordons à certains peuples. Les Turcs, si pittoresques autrefois\\navec leurs longues robes aux vives couleurs, ne sont-ils pas hideux\\nmaintenant avec leurs redingotes bleues boutonnées et leurs calottes\\ngrecques qui leur donnent l'air de bouteilles de vin à cachet rouge?\\n\\nFranz fit ses compliments à Albert, qui, au reste, debout devant la\\nglace, se souriait avec un air de satisfaction qui n'avait rien\\nd'équivoque.\\n\\nIls en étaient là lorsque le comte de Monte-Cristo entra.\\n\\n«Messieurs, leur dit-il, comme, si agréable que soit un compagnon de\\nplaisir, la liberté est plus agréable encore, je viens vous dire que\\npour aujourd'hui et les jours suivants je laisse à votre disposition la\\nvoiture dont vous vous êtes servis hier. Notre hôte a dû vous dire que\\nj'en avais trois ou quatre en pension chez lui, vous ne m'en privez donc\\npas: usez-en librement, soit pour aller à votre plaisir, soit pour aller\\nà vos affaires. Notre rendez-vous, si nous avons quelque chose à nous\\ndire, sera au palais Rospoli.»\\n\\nLes deux jeunes gens voulurent lui faire quelque observation, mais ils\\nn'avaient véritablement aucune bonne raison de refuser une offre qui\\nd'ailleurs leur était agréable. Ils finirent donc par accepter.\\n\\nLe comte de Monte-Cristo resta un quart d'heure à peu près avec eux,\\nparlant de toutes choses avec une facilité extrême. Il était, comme on a\\ndéjà pu le remarquer, fort au courant de la littérature de tous les\\npays. Un coup d'oeil jeté sur les murailles de son salon avait prouvé à\\nFranz et à Albert qu'il était amateur de tableaux. Quelques mots sans\\nprétention, qu'il laissa tomber en passant, leur prouvèrent que les\\nsciences ne lui étaient pas étrangères; il paraissait surtout s'être\\nparticulièrement occupé de chimie.\\n\\nLes deux amis n'avaient pas la prétention de rendre au comte le déjeuner\\nqu'il leur avait donné; ç'eût été une trop mauvaise plaisanterie à lui\\nfaire que lui offrir, en échange de son excellente table, l'ordinaire\\nfort médiocre de maître Pastrini. Ils le lui dirent tout franchement, et\\nil reçut leurs excuses en homme qui appréciait leur délicatesse.\\n\\nAlbert était ravi des manières du comte, que sa science seule\\nl'empêchait de reconnaître pour un véritable gentilhomme. La liberté de\\ndisposer entièrement de la voiture le comblait surtout de joie: il avait\\nses vues sur ses gracieuses paysannes; et, comme elles lui étaient\\napparues la veille dans une voiture fort élégante, il n'était pas fâché\\nde continuer à paraître sur ce point avec elles sur un pied d'égalité.\\n\\nÀ une heure et demie, les deux jeunes gens descendirent; le cocher et\\nles laquais avaient eu l'idée de mettre leurs habits de livrées sur\\nleurs peaux de bêtes, ce qui leur donnait une tournure encore plus\\ngrotesque que la veille, et ce qui leur valut tous les compliments de\\nFranz et d'Albert.\\n\\nAlbert avait attaché sentimentalement son bouquet de violettes fanées à\\nsa boutonnière.\\n\\nAu premier son de cloche, ils partirent et se précipitèrent dans la rue\\ndu Cours par la via Vittoria.\\n\\nAu second tour, un bouquet de violettes fraîches, parti d'une calèche\\nchargée de paillassines, et qui vint tomber dans la calèche du comte,\\nindiqua à Albert que, comme lui et son ami, les paysannes de la veille\\navaient changé de costume, et que, soit par hasard, soit par un\\nsentiment pareil à celui qui l'avait fait agir, tandis qu'il avait\\ngalamment pris leur costume, elles, de leur côté, avaient pris le sien.\\n\\nAlbert mit le bouquet frais à la place de l'autre, mais il garda le\\nbouquet fané dans sa main; et, quand il croisa de nouveau la calèche, il\\nle porta amoureusement à ses lèvres: action qui parut récréer beaucoup\\nnon seulement celle qui le lui avait jeté, mais encore ses folles\\ncompagnes.\\n\\nLa journée fut non moins animée que la veille: il est probable même\\nqu'un profond observateur y eût encore reconnu une augmentation de bruit\\net de gaieté. Un instant on aperçut le comte à la fenêtre; mais lorsque\\nla voiture repassa il avait déjà disparu.\\n\\nIl va sans dire que l'échange de coquetteries entre Albert et la\\npaillassine aux bouquets de violettes dura toute la journée.\\n\\nLe soir, en rentrant, Franz trouva une lettre de l'ambassade; on lui\\nannonçait qu'il aurait l'honneur d'être reçu le lendemain par Sa\\nSainteté. À chaque voyage précédent qu'il avait fait à Rome, il avait\\nsollicité et obtenu la même faveur; et, autant par religion que par\\nreconnaissance, il n'avait pas voulu toucher barre dans la capitale du\\nmonde chrétien sans mettre son respectueux hommage aux pieds d'un des\\nsuccesseurs de saint Pierre qui a donné le rare exemple de toutes les\\nvertus.\\n\\nIl ne s'agissait donc pas pour lui, ce jour-là, de songer au carnaval;\\ncar, malgré la bonté dont il entoure sa grandeur, c'est toujours avec un\\nrespect plein de profonde émotion que l'on s'apprête à s'incliner devant\\nce noble et saint vieillard qu'on nomme Grégoire XVI.\\n\\nEn sortant du Vatican, Franz revint droit à l'hôtel en évitant même de\\npasser par la rue du Cours. Il emportait un trésor de pieuses pensées,\\npour lesquelles le contact des folles joies de la mascherata eût été une\\nprofanation.\\n\\nÀ cinq heures dix minutes, Albert rentra. Il était au comble de la joie;\\nla paillassine avait repris son costume de paysanne, et en croisant la\\ncalèche d'Albert elle avait levé son masque.\\n\\nElle était charmante.\\n\\nFranz fit à Albert ses compliments bien sincères; il les reçut en homme\\nà qui ils sont dus. Il avait reconnu, disait-il, à certains signes\\nd'élégance inimitable, que sa belle inconnue devait appartenir à la plus\\nhaute aristocratie.\\n\\nIl était décidé à lui écrire le lendemain.\\n\\nFranz, tout en recevant cette confidence, remarqua qu'Albert paraissait\\navoir quelque chose à lui demander, et que cependant il hésitait à lui\\nadresser cette demande. Il insista, en lui déclarant d'avance qu'il\\nétait prêt à faire, au profit de son bonheur, tous les sacrifices qui\\nseraient en son pouvoir. Albert se fit prier tout juste le temps\\nqu'exigeait une amicale politesse: puis enfin il avoua à Franz qu'il lui\\nrendrait service en lui abandonnant pour le lendemain la calèche à lui\\ntout seul.\\n\\nAlbert attribuait à l'absence de son ami l'extrême bonté qu'avait eue\\nla belle paysanne de soulever son masque.\\n\\nOn comprend que Franz n'était pas assez égoïste pour arrêter Albert au\\nmilieu d'une aventure qui promettait à la fois d'être si agréable pour\\nsa curiosité et si flatteuse pour son amour-propre. Il connaissait assez\\nla parfaite indiscrétion de son digne ami pour être sûr qu'il le\\ntiendrait au courant des moindres détails de sa bonne fortune; et comme,\\ndepuis deux ou trois ans qu'il parcourait l'Italie en tous sens, il\\nn'avait jamais eu la chance même d'ébaucher semblable intrigue pour son\\ncompte, Franz n'était pas fâché d'apprendre comment les choses se\\npassaient en pareil cas.\\n\\nIl promit donc à Albert qu'il se contenterait le lendemain de regarder\\nle spectacle des fenêtres du palais Rospoli.\\n\\nEn effet, le lendemain il vit passer et repasser Albert. Il avait un\\nénorme bouquet que sans doute il avait chargé d'être le porteur de son\\népître amoureuse. Cette probabilité se chargea en certitude quand Franz\\nrevit le même bouquet, remarquable par un cercle de camélias blancs,\\nentre les mains d'une charmante paillassine habillée de satin rose.\\n\\nAussi le soir ce n'était plus de la joie, c'était du délire. Albert ne\\ndoutait pas que la belle inconnue ne lui répondit par la même voie.\\nFranz alla au-devant de ses désirs en lui disant que tout ce bruit le\\nfatiguait, et qu'il était décidé à employer la journée du lendemain à\\nrevoir son album et à prendre des notes.\\n\\nAu reste, Albert ne s'était pas trompé dans ses prévisions: le\\nlendemain au soir Franz le vit entrer d'un seul bond dans sa chambre,\\nsecouant machinalement un carré de papier qu'il tenait par un de ses\\nangles.\\n\\n«Eh bien, dit-il, m'étais-je trompé?\\n\\n--Elle a répondu? s'écria Franz.\\n\\n--Lisez.»\\n\\nCe mot fut prononcé avec une intonation impossible à rendre. Franz prit\\nle billet et lut:\\n\\n«Mardi soir, à sept heures, descendez de votre voiture en face de la\\nvia dei Pontefici, et suivez la paysanne romaine qui vous arrachera\\nvotre moccoletto. Lorsque vous arriverez sur la première marche de\\nl'église de San-Giacomo, ayez soin, pour qu'elle puisse vous\\nreconnaître, de nouer un ruban rose sur l'épaule de votre costume de\\npaillasse.\\n\\n«D'ici là vous ne me verrez plus.\\n\\n«Constance et discrétion.»\\n\\n«Eh bien, dit-il à Franz, lorsque celui-ci eut terminé cette lecture,\\nque pensez-vous de cela, cher ami?\\n\\n--Mais je pense, répondit Franz, que la chose prend tout le caractère\\nd'une aventure fort agréable.\\n\\n--C'est mon avis aussi, dit Albert, et j'ai grand peur que vous n'alliez\\nseul au bal du duc de Bracciano.»\\n\\nFranz et Albert avaient reçu le matin même chacun une invitation du\\ncélèbre banquier romain.\\n\\n«Prenez garde, mon cher Albert, dit Franz, toute l'aristocratie sera\\nchez le duc; et si votre belle inconnue est véritablement de\\nl'aristocratie, elle ne pourra se dispenser d'y paraître.\\n\\n--Qu'elle y paraisse ou non, je maintiens mon opinion sur elle, continua\\nAlbert. Vous avez lu le billet?\\n\\n--Oui.\\n\\n--Vous savez la pauvre éducation que reçoivent en Italie les femmes du\\nmezzo cito?»\\n\\nOn appelle ainsi la bourgeoisie.\\n\\n«Oui, répondit encore Franz.\\n\\n--Eh bien, relisez ce billet, examinez l'écriture et cherchez-moi une\\nfaute ou de langue ou d'orthographe.»\\n\\nEn effet, l'écriture était charmante et l'orthographe irréprochable.\\n\\n«Vous êtes prédestiné, dit Franz à Albert en lui rendant pour la seconde\\nfois le billet.\\n\\n--Riez tant que vous voudrez, plaisantez tout à votre aise, reprit\\nAlbert, je suis amoureux.\\n\\n--Oh! mon Dieu! vous m'effrayez! s'écria Franz, et je vois que non\\nseulement j'irai seul au bal du duc de Bracciano, mais encore que je\\npourrais bien retourner seul à Florence.\\n\\n--Le fait est que si mon inconnue est aussi aimable qu'elle est belle,\\nje vous déclare que je me fixe à Rome pour six semaines au moins.\\nJ'adore Rome, et d'ailleurs j'ai toujours eu un goût marqué pour\\nl'archéologie.\\n\\n--Allons, encore une rencontre ou deux comme celle-là, et je ne\\ndésespère pas de vous voir membre de l'Académie des Inscriptions et\\nBelles-Lettres.»\\n\\nSans doute Albert allait discuter sérieusement ses droits au fauteuil\\nacadémique, mais on vint annoncer aux deux jeunes gens qu'ils étaient\\nservis. Or, l'amour chez Albert n'était nullement contraire à l'appétit.\\nIl s'empressa donc, ainsi que son ami, de se mettre à table, quitte à\\nreprendre la discussion après le dîner.\\n\\nAprès le dîner, on annonça le comte de Monte-Cristo. Depuis deux jours\\nles jeunes gens ne l'avaient pas aperçu. Une affaire, avait dit maître\\nPastrini, l'avait appelé à Civita-Vecchia. Il était parti la veille au\\nsoir, et se trouvait de retour depuis une heure seulement.\\n\\nLe comte fut charmant; soit qu'il s'observât, soit que l'occasion\\nn'éveillât point chez lui les fibres acrimonieuses que certaines\\ncirconstances avaient déjà fait résonner deux ou trois fois dans ses\\namères paroles, il fut à peu près comme tout le monde. Cet homme était\\npour Franz une véritable énigme. Le comte ne pouvait douter que le jeune\\nvoyageur ne l'eût reconnu; et cependant, pas une seule parole, depuis\\nleur nouvelle rencontre ne semblait indiquer dans sa bouche qu'il se\\nrappelât l'avoir vu ailleurs. De son côté, quelque envie qu'eut Franz de\\nfaire allusion à leur première entrevue, la crainte d'être désagréable à\\nun homme qui l'avait comblé, lui et son ami, de prévenances, le\\nretenait; il continua donc de rester sur la même réserve que lui.\\n\\nIl avait appris que les deux amis avaient voulu faire prendre une loge\\ndans le théâtre Argentina, et qu'il leur avait répondu que tout était\\nloué.\\n\\nEn conséquence, il leur apportait la clef de la sienne; du moins c'était\\nle motif apparent de sa visite.\\n\\nFranz et Albert firent quelques difficultés, alléguant la crainte de\\nl'en priver lui-même, mais le comte leur répondit qu'allant ce soir-là\\nau théâtre Palli, sa loge au théâtre Argentina serait perdue s'ils n'en\\nprofitaient pas.\\n\\nCette assurance détermina les deux amis à accepter.\\n\\nFranz s'était peu à peu habitué à cette pâleur du comte qui l'avait si\\nfort frappé la première fois qu'il l'avait vu. Il ne pouvait s'empêcher\\nde rendre justice à la beauté de sa tête sévère, dont la pâleur était le\\nseul défaut ou peut-être la principale qualité. Véritable héros de\\nByron, Franz ne pouvait, nous ne dirons pas le voir, mais seulement\\nsonger à lui sans qu'il se représentât ce visage sombre sur les épaules\\nde Manfred ou sous la toque de Lara. Il avait ce pli du front qui\\nindique la présence incessante d'une pensée amère, il avait ces yeux\\nardents qui lisent au plus profond des âmes; il avait cette lèvre\\nhautaine et moqueuse qui donne aux paroles qui s'en échappent ce\\ncaractère particulier qui fait qu'elles se gravent profondément dans la\\nmémoire de ceux qui les écoutent.\\n\\nLe comte n'était plus jeune; il avait quarante ans au moins, et\\ncependant on comprenait à merveille qu'il était fait pour l'emporter sur\\nles jeunes gens avec lesquels il se trouverait. En réalité, c'est que,\\npar une dernière ressemblance avec les héros fantastiques du poète\\nanglais, le comte semblait avoir le don de la fascination.\\n\\nAlbert ne tarissait pas sur le bonheur que lui et Franz avaient eu de\\nrencontrer un pareil homme. Franz était moins enthousiaste, et cependant\\nil subissait l'influence qu'exerce tout homme supérieur sur l'esprit de\\nceux qui l'entourent.\\n\\nIl pensait à ce projet qu'avait déjà deux ou trois fois manifesté le\\ncomte d'aller à Paris, et il ne doutait pas qu'avec son caractère\\nexcentrique, son visage caractérisé et sa fortune colossale le comte n'y\\nproduisit le plus grand effet.\\n\\nEt cependant il ne désirait pas se trouver à Paris quand il y viendrait.\\n\\nLa soirée se passa comme les soirées se passent d'habitude au théâtre en\\nItalie, non pas à écouter les chanteurs, mais à faire des visites et à\\ncauser. La comtesse G... voulait ramener la conversation sur le comte,\\nmais Franz lui annonça qu'il avait quelque chose de beaucoup plus\\nnouveau à lui apprendre, et, malgré les démonstrations de fausse\\nmodestie auxquelles se livra Albert, il raconta à la comtesse le grand\\névénement qui, depuis trois jours, formait l'objet de la préoccupation\\ndes deux amis.\\n\\nComme ces intrigues ne sont pas rares en Italie, du moins s'il faut en\\ncroire les voyageurs, la comtesse ne fit pas le moins du monde\\nl'incrédule, et félicita Albert sur les commencements d'une aventure qui\\npromettait de se terminer d'une façon si satisfaisante.\\n\\nOn se quitta en se promettant de se retrouver au bal du duc de\\nBracciano, auquel Rome entière était invitée.\\n\\nLa dame au bouquet tint sa promesse: ni le lendemain ni le surlendemain\\nelle ne donna à Albert signe d'existence.\\n\\nEnfin arriva le mardi, le dernier et le plus bruyant des jours du\\ncarnaval. Le mardi, les théâtres s'ouvrent à dix heures du matin; car,\\npassé huit heures du soir, on entre dans le carême. Le mardi, tout ce\\nqui, faute de temps, d'argent ou d'enthousiasme, n'a pas pris part\\nencore aux fêtes précédentes, se mêle à la bacchanale, se laisse\\nentraîner par l'orgie, et apporte sa part de bruit et de mouvement au\\nmouvement et au bruit général.\\n\\nDepuis deux heures jusqu'à cinq heures, Franz et Albert suivirent la\\nfile, échangeant des poignées de confetti avec les voitures de la file\\nopposée et les piétons qui circulaient entre les pieds des chevaux,\\nentre les roues des carrosses, sans qu'il survînt au milieu de cette\\naffreuse cohue un seul accident, une seule dispute, une seule rixe. Les\\nItaliens sont le peuple par excellence sous ce rapport. Les fêtes sont\\npour eux de véritables fêtes. L'auteur de cette histoire, qui a habité\\nl'Italie cinq ou six ans, ne se rappelle pas avoir jamais vu une\\nsolennité troublée par un seul de ces événements qui servent toujours de\\ncorollaire aux nôtres.\\n\\nAlbert triomphait dans son costume de paillasse. Il avait sur l'épaule\\nun noeud de ruban rose dont les extrémités lui tombaient jusqu'aux\\njarrets. Pour n'amener aucune confusion entre lui et Franz celui-ci\\navait conservé son costume de paysan romain.\\n\\nPlus la journée s'avançait, plus le tumulte devenait grand; il n'y avait\\npas sur tous ces pavés, dans toutes ces voitures, à toutes ces fenêtres,\\nune bouche qui restât muette, un bras qui demeurât oisif, c'était\\nvéritablement un orage humain composé d'un tonnerre de cris et d'une\\ngrêle de dragées, de bouquets, d'oeufs, d'oranges, de fleurs.\\n\\nÀ trois heures, le bruit de boîtes tirées à la fois sur la place du\\nPeuple et au palais de Venise, perçant à grand-peine cet horrible\\ntumulte, annonça que les courses allaient commencer.\\n\\nLes courses, comme les moccoli, sont un des épisodes particuliers des\\nderniers jours du carnaval. Au bruit de ces boîtes, les voitures\\nrompirent à l'instant même leurs rangs et se réfugièrent chacune dans la\\nrue transversale la plus proche de l'endroit où elles se trouvaient.\\n\\nToutes ces évolutions se font, au reste, avec une inconcevable adresse\\net une merveilleuse rapidité, et cela sans que la police se préoccupe le\\nmoins du monde d'assigner à chacun son poste ou de tracer à chacun sa\\nroute.\\n\\nLes piétons se collèrent contre les palais, puis on entendit un grand\\nbruit de chevaux et de fourreaux de sabre.\\n\\nUne escouade de carabiniers sur quinze de front parcourait au galop et\\ndans toute sa largeur la rue du Cours, qu'elle balayait pour faire place\\naux barberi. Lorsque l'escouade arriva au palais de Venise, le\\nretentissement d'une autre batterie de boîtes annonça que la rue était\\nlibre.\\n\\nPresque aussitôt, au milieu d'une clameur immense, universelle, inouïe,\\non vit passer comme des ombres sept ou huit chevaux excités par les\\nclameurs de trois cent mille personnes et par les châtaignes de fer qui\\nleur bondissent sur le dos; puis le canon du château Saint-Ange tira\\ntrois coups: c'était pour annoncer que le numéro trois avait gagné.\\n\\nAussitôt sans autre signal que celui-là, les voitures se remirent en\\nmouvement, refluant vers le Corso, débordant par toutes les rues comme\\ndes torrents un instant contenus qui se rejettent tous ensemble dans le\\nlit du fleuve qu'ils alimentent, et le flot immense reprit, plus rapide\\nque jamais, son cours entre les deux rives de granit.\\n\\nSeulement un nouvel élément de bruit et de mouvement s'était encore mêlé\\nà cette foule: les marchands de moccoli venaient d'entrer en scène.\\n\\nLes moccoli ou moccoletti sont des bougies qui varient de grosseur,\\ndepuis le cierge pascal jusqu'au rat de cave, et qui éveillent chez les\\nacteurs de la grande scène qui termine le carnaval romain deux\\npréoccupations opposées:\\n\\n1º Celle de conserver allumé son moccoletto;\\n\\n2º Celle d'éteindre le moccoletto des autres.\\n\\nIl en est du moccoletto comme de la vie: l'homme n'a encore trouvé qu'un\\nmoyen de la transmettre; et ce moyen il le tient de Dieu.\\n\\nMais il a découvert mille moyens de l'ôter; il est vrai que pour cette\\nsuprême opération le diable lui est quelque peu venu en aide.\\n\\nLe moccoletto s'allume en l'approchant d'une lumière quelconque.\\n\\nMais qui décrira les mille moyens inventés pour éteindre le moccoletto,\\nles soufflets gigantesques, les éteignoirs monstres, les éventails\\nsurhumains?\\n\\nChacun se hâta donc d'acheter des moccoletti, Franz et Albert comme les\\nautres.\\n\\nLa nuit s'approchait rapidement; et déjà, au cri de: _Moccoli_! répété\\npar les voix stridentes d'un millier d'industriels, deux ou trois\\nétoiles commencèrent à briller au-dessus de la foule. Ce fut comme un\\nsignal.\\n\\nAu bout de dix minutes, cinquante mille lumières scintillèrent\\ndescendant du palais de Venise à la place du Peuple, et remontant de la\\nplace du Peuple au palais de Venise.\\n\\nOn eût dit la fête des feux follets.\\n\\nOn ne peut se faire une idée de cet aspect si on ne l'a pas vu.\\n\\nSupposez toutes les étoiles se détachant du ciel et venant se mêler sur\\nla terre à une danse insensée.\\n\\nLe tout accompagné de cris comme jamais oreille humaine n'en a entendu\\nsur le reste de la surface du globe.\\n\\nC'est en ce moment surtout qu'il n'y a plus de distinction sociale. Le\\nfacchino s'attache au prince, le prince au Transtévère, le Transtévère\\nau bourgeois chacun soufflant, éteignant, rallumant. Si le vieil Éole\\napparaissait en ce moment, il serait proclamé roi des moccoli, et\\nAquilon héritier présomptif de la couronne.\\n\\nCette course folle et flamboyante dura deux heures à peu près; la rue du\\nCours était éclairée comme en plein jour, on distinguait les traits des\\nspectateurs jusqu'au troisième et quatrième étage.\\n\\nDe cinq minutes en cinq minutes Albert tirait sa montre; enfin elle\\nmarqua sept heures.\\n\\nLes deux amis se trouvaient justement à la hauteur de la via dei\\nPontefici; Albert sauta à bas de la calèche, son moccoletto à la main.\\n\\nDeux ou trois masques voulurent s'approcher de lui pour l'éteindre ou le\\nlui arracher, mais, en habile boxeur, Albert les envoya les uns après\\nles autres rouler à dix pas de lui en continuant sa course vers l'église\\nde San-Giacomo.\\n\\nLes degrés étaient chargés de curieux et de masques qui luttaient à qui\\ns'arracherait le flambeau des mains. Franz suivait des yeux Albert, et\\nle vit mettre le pied sur la première marche; puis presque aussitôt un\\nmasque, portant le costume bien connu de la paysanne au bouquet,\\nallongea le bras, et, sans que cette fois il fît aucune résistance, lui\\nenleva le moccoletto.\\n\\nFranz était trop loin pour entendre les paroles qu'ils échangèrent, mais\\nsans doute elles n'eurent rien d'hostile, car il vit s'éloigner Albert\\net la paysanne bras dessus, bras dessous.\\n\\nQuelque temps il les suivit au milieu de la foule, mais à la via Macello\\nil les perdit de vue.\\n\\nTout à coup le son de la cloche qui donne le signal de la clôture du\\ncarnaval retentit, et au même instant tous les moccoli s'éteignirent\\ncomme par enchantement. On eût dit qu'une seule et immense bouffée de\\nvent avait tout anéanti.\\n\\nFranz se trouva dans l'obscurité la plus profonde.\\n\\nDu même coup tous les cris cessèrent, comme si le souffle puissant qui\\navait emporté les lumières emportait en même temps le bruit.\\n\\nOn n'entendit plus que le roulement des carrosses qui ramenaient les\\nmasques chez eux; on ne vit plus que les rares lumières qui brillaient\\nderrière les fenêtres.\\n\\nLe carnaval était fini.\",\n",
       " 'XXXVII': \"Peut-être, de sa vie, Franz n'avait-il éprouvé une impression si\\ntranchée, un passage si rapide de la gaieté à la tristesse, que dans ce\\nmoment; on eût dit que Rome, sous le souffle magique de quelque démon de\\nla nuit, venait de se changer en un vaste tombeau. Par un hasard qui\\najoutait encore à l'intensité des ténèbres, la lune, qui était dans sa\\ndécroissance ne devait se lever que vers les onze heures du soir; les\\nrues que le jeune homme traversait étaient donc plongées dans la plus\\nprofonde obscurité. Au reste, le trajet était court; au bout de dix\\nminutes, sa voiture ou plutôt celle du comte s'arrêta devant l'hôtel de\\nLondres.\\n\\nLe dîner attendait; mais comme Albert avait prévenu qu'il ne comptait\\npas rentrer de sitôt, Franz se mit à table sans lui.\\n\\nMaître Pastrini, qui avait l'habitude de les voir dîner ensemble,\\ns'informa des causes de son absence; mais Franz se contenta de répondre\\nqu'Albert avait reçu la surveille une invitation à laquelle il s'était\\nrendu. L'extinction subite des moccoletti, cette obscurité qui avait\\nremplacé la lumière, ce silence qui avait succédé au bruit, avaient\\nlaissé dans l'esprit de Franz une certaine tristesse qui n'était pas\\nexempte d'inquiétude. Il dîna donc fort silencieusement malgré\\nl'officieuse sollicitude de son hôte, qui entra deux ou trois fois pour\\ns'informer s'il n'avait besoin de rien.\\n\\nFranz était résolu à attendre Albert aussi tard que possible. Il demanda\\ndonc la voiture pour onze heures seulement, en priant maître Pastrini de\\nle faire prévenir à l'instant même si Albert reparaissait à l'hôtel pour\\nquelque chose que ce fût. À onze heures, Albert n'était pas rentré.\\nFranz s'habilla et partit, en prévenant son hôte qu'il passait la nuit\\nchez le duc de Bracciano.\\n\\nLa maison du duc de Bracciano est une des plus charmantes maisons de\\nRome; sa femme, une des dernières héritières des Colonna, en fait les\\nhonneurs d'une façon parfaite: il en résulte que les fêtes qu'il donne\\nont une célébrité européenne. Franz et Albert étaient arrivés à Rome\\navec des lettres de recommandation pour lui; aussi sa première question\\nfut-elle pour demander à Franz ce qu'était devenu son compagnon de\\nvoyage. Franz lui répondit qu'il l'avait quitté au moment où on allait\\néteindre les moccoli, et qu'il l'avait perdu de vue à la via Macello.\\n\\n«Alors il n'est pas rentré? demanda le duc.\\n\\n--Je l'ai attendu jusqu'à cette heure, répondit Franz.\\n\\n--Et savez-vous où il allait?\\n\\n--Non, pas précisément; cependant je crois qu'il s'agissait de quelque\\nchose comme un rendez-vous.\\n\\n--Diable! dit le duc, c'est un mauvais jour, ou plutôt c'est une\\nmauvaise nuit pour s'attarder, n'est-ce pas, madame la comtesse?»\\n\\nCes derniers mots s'adressaient à la comtesse G... qui venait d'arriver,\\net qui se promenait au bras de M. Torlonia, frère du duc.\\n\\n«Je trouve au contraire que c'est une charmante nuit, répondit la\\ncomtesse; et ceux qui sont ici ne se plaindront que d'une chose, c'est\\nqu'elle passera trop vite.\\n\\n--Aussi, reprit le duc en souriant, je ne parle pas des personnes qui\\nsont ici, elles ne courent d'autres dangers, les hommes que de devenir\\namoureux de vous, les femmes de tomber malades de jalousie en vous\\nvoyant si belle; je parle de ceux qui courent les rues de Rome.\\n\\n--Eh! bon Dieu, demanda la comtesse, qui court les rues de Rome à cette\\nheure-ci, à moins que ce ne soit pour aller au bal?\\n\\n--Notre ami Albert de Morcerf, madame la comtesse, que j'ai quitté à la\\npoursuite de son inconnue vers les sept heures du soir, dit Franz, et\\nque je n'ai pas revu depuis.\\n\\n--Comment! et vous ne savez pas où il est?\\n\\n--Pas le moins du monde.\\n\\n--Et a-t-il des armes?\\n\\n--Il est en paillasse.\\n\\n--Vous n'auriez pas dû le laisser aller, dit le duc à Franz, vous qui\\nconnaissez Rome mieux que lui.\\n\\n--Oh! bien oui, autant aurait valu essayer d'arrêter le numéro trois des\\nbarberi qui a gagné aujourd'hui le prix de la course, répondit Franz;\\net puis, d'ailleurs, que voulez-vous qu'il lui arrive?\\n\\n--Qui sait! la nuit est très sombre, et le Tibre est bien près de la via\\nMacello.»\\n\\nFranz sentit un frisson qui lui courait dans les veines en voyant\\nl'esprit du duc et de la comtesse si bien d'accord avec ses inquiétudes\\npersonnelles.\\n\\n«Aussi ai-je prévenu à l'hôtel que j'avais l'honneur de passer la nuit\\nchez vous, monsieur le duc, dit Franz, et on doit venir m'annoncer son\\nretour.\\n\\n--Tenez, dit le duc, je crois justement que voilà un de mes domestiques\\nqui vous cherche.»\\n\\nLe duc ne se trompait pas; en apercevant Franz, le domestique s'approcha\\nde lui:\\n\\n«Excellence, dit-il, le maître de l'hôtel de Londres vous fait prévenir\\nqu'un homme vous attend chez lui avec une lettre du vicomte de Morcerf.\\n\\n--Avec une lettre du vicomte! s'écria Franz.\\n\\n--Oui.\\n\\n--Et quel est cet homme?\\n\\n--Je l'ignore.\\n\\n--Pourquoi n'est-il point venu me l'apporter ici?\\n\\n--Le messager ne m'a donné aucune explication.\\n\\n--Et où est le messager?\\n\\n--Il est parti aussitôt qu'il m'a vu entrer dans la salle du bal pour\\nvous prévenir.\\n\\n--Oh! mon Dieu! dit la comtesse à Franz, allez vite. Pauvre jeune homme,\\nil lui est peut-être arrivé quelque accident.\\n\\n--J'y cours, dit Franz.\\n\\n--Vous reverrons-nous pour nous donner des nouvelles? demanda la\\ncomtesse.\\n\\n--Oui, si la chose n'est pas grave; sinon, je ne réponds pas de ce que\\nje vais devenir moi-même.\\n\\n--En tout cas, de la prudence, dit la comtesse.\\n\\n--Oh! soyez tranquille.»\\n\\nFranz prit son chapeau et partit en toute hâte. Il avait renvoyé sa\\nvoiture en lui donnant l'ordre pour deux heures; mais, par bonheur, le\\npalais Bracciano, qui donne d'un côté rue du Cours et de l'autre place\\ndes Saints-Apôtres, est à dix minutes de chemin à peine de l'hôtel de\\nLondres. En approchant de l'hôtel, Franz vit un homme debout au milieu\\nde la rue, il ne douta pas un seul instant que ce ne fût le messager\\nd'Albert. Cet homme était lui-même enveloppé d'un grand manteau. Il alla\\nà lui; mais au grand étonnement de Franz, ce fut cet homme qui lui\\nadressa la parole le premier.\\n\\n«Que me voulez-vous, Excellence? dit-il en faisant un pas en arrière\\ncomme un homme qui désire demeurer sur ses gardes.\\n\\n--N'est-ce pas vous, demanda Franz, qui m'apportez une lettre du vicomte\\nde Morcerf?\\n\\n--C'est Votre Excellence qui loge à l'hôtel de Pastrini?\\n\\n--Oui.\\n\\n--C'est Votre Excellence qui est le compagnon de voyage du vicomte?\\n\\n--Oui.\\n\\n--Comment s'appelle Votre Excellence?\\n\\n--Le baron Franz d'Épinay.\\n\\n--C'est bien à Votre Excellence alors que cette lettre est adressée.\\n\\n--Y a-t-il une réponse? demanda Franz en lui prenant la lettre des\\nmains.\\n\\n--Oui, du moins votre ami l'espère bien.\\n\\n--Montez chez moi, alors, je vous la donnerai.\\n\\n--J'aime mieux l'attendre ici, dit en riant le messager.\\n\\n--Pourquoi cela?\\n\\n--Votre Excellence comprendra la chose quand elle aura lu la lettre.\\n\\n--Alors je vous retrouverai ici?\\n\\n--Sans aucun doute.»\\n\\nFranz rentra; sur l'escalier il rencontra maître Pastrini.\\n\\n«Eh bien? lui demanda-t-il.\\n\\n--Eh bien quoi? répondit Franz.\\n\\n--Vous avez vu l'homme qui désirait vous parler de la part de votre ami?\\ndemanda-t-il à Franz.\\n\\n--Oui, je l'ai vu, répondit celui-ci, et il m'a remis cette lettre.\\nFaites allumer chez moi, je vous prie.»\\n\\nL'aubergiste donna l'ordre à un domestique de précéder Franz avec une\\nbougie. Le jeune homme avait trouvé à maître Pastrini un air effaré, et\\ncet air ne lui avait donné qu'un désir plus grand de lire la lettre\\nd'Albert: il s'approcha de la bougie aussitôt qu'elle fut allumée, et\\ndéplia le papier. La lettre était écrite de la main d'Albert et signée\\npar lui. Franz la relut deux fois, tant il était loin de s'attendre à ce\\nqu'elle contenait.\\n\\nLa voici textuellement reproduite:\\n\\n_«Cher ami, aussitôt la présente reçue, ayez l'obligeance de prendre\\ndans mon portefeuille, que vous trouverez dans le tiroir carré du\\nsecrétaire, la lettre de crédit; joignez-y la vôtre si elle n'est pas\\nsuffisante. Courez chez Torlonia, prenez-y à l'instant même quatre mille\\npiastres et remettez-les au porteur. Il est urgent que cette somme me\\nsoit adressée sans aucun retard._\\n\\n«_Je n'insiste pas davantage, comptant sur vous comme vous pourriez\\ncompter sur moi._\\n\\n«_P.-S. I believe now to italian banditti._\\n\\n«_Votre ami,_\\n\\n                     «ALBERT DE MORCERF.»\\n\\nAu-dessous de ces lignes étaient écrits d'une main étrangère ces\\nquelques mots italiens:\\n\\n_»Se alle sei della mattina le quattro mille piastre non sono nelle mie\\nmani, alle sette il comte Alberto avrà cessato di vivere._[1]\\n\\n                             «LUIGI VAMPA.»\\n\\n\\n[Note 1: Si, à six heures du matin, les quatre mille piastres ne\\nsont point entre mes mains, à sept heures, le vicomte Albert de Morcerf\\naura cessé d'exister.]\\n\\nCette seconde signature expliqua tout à Franz, qui comprit la\\nrépugnance du messager à monter chez lui; la rue lui paraissait plus\\nsûre que la chambre de Franz. Albert était tombé entre les mains du\\nfameux chef de bandits à l'existence duquel il s'était si longtemps\\nrefusé de croire.\\n\\nIl n'y avait pas de temps à perdre. Il courut au secrétaire, l'ouvrit,\\ndans le tiroir indiqué trouva le portefeuille, et dans le portefeuille\\nla lettre de crédit: elle était en tout de six mille piastres, mais sur\\nces six mille piastres Albert en avait déjà dépensé trois mille. Quant à\\nFranz, il n'avait aucune lettre de crédit; comme il habitait Florence,\\net qu'il était venu à Rome pour passer sept à huit jours seulement, il\\navait pris une centaine de louis, et de ces cent louis il en restait\\ncinquante tout au plus.\\n\\nIl s'en fallait donc de sept à huit cents piastres pour qu'à eux deux\\nFranz et Albert pussent réunir la somme demandée. Il est vrai que Franz\\npouvait compter, dans un cas pareil, sur l'obligeance de MM. Torlonia.\\n\\nIl se préparait donc à retourner au palais Bracciano sans perdre un\\ninstant, quand tout à coup une idée lumineuse traversa son esprit.\\n\\nIl songea au comte de Monte-Cristo. Franz allait donner l'ordre qu'on\\nfît venir maître Pastrini, lorsqu'il le vit apparaître en personne sur\\nle seuil de sa porte.\\n\\n«Mon cher monsieur Pastrini, lui dit-il vivement, croyez-vous que le\\ncomte soit chez lui?\\n\\n--Oui, Excellence, il vient de rentrer.\\n\\n--A-t-il eu le temps de se mettre au lit?\\n\\n--J'en doute.\\n\\n--Alors, sonnez à sa porte, je vous prie, et demandez-lui pour moi la\\npermission de me présenter chez lui.»\\n\\nMaître Pastrini s'empressa de suivre les instructions qu'on lui donnait;\\ncinq minutes après il était de retour.\\n\\n«Le comte attend Votre Excellence», dit-il.\\n\\nFranz traversa le carré, un domestique l'introduisit chez le comte. Il\\nétait dans un petit cabinet que Franz n'avait pas encore vu, et qui\\nétait entouré de divans. Le comte vint au-devant de lui.\\n\\n«Eh! quel bon vent vous amène à cette heure, lui dit-il; viendriez-vous\\nme demander à souper, par hasard? Ce serait pardieu bien aimable à vous.\\n\\n--Non, je viens pour vous parler d'une affaire grave.\\n\\n--D'une affaire! dit le comte en regardant Franz de ce regard profond\\nqui lui était habituel; et de quelle affaire?\\n\\n--Sommes-nous seuls?»\\n\\nLe comte alla à la porte et revint.\\n\\n«Parfaitement seuls», dit-il.\\n\\nFranz lui présenta la lettre d'Albert.\\n\\n«Lisez», lui dit-il.\\n\\nLe comte lut la lettre.\\n\\n«Ah! ah! fit-il.\\n\\n--Avez-vous pris connaissance du post-scriptum?\\n\\n--Oui, dit-il, je vois bien:\\n\\n«_Se alle sei della mattina le quattro mille piastre non sono nelle mie\\nmani, alle sette il comte Alberto avrà cessato di vivere._\\n\\n                            «LUIGI VAMPA.»\\n\\n«Que dites-vous de cela? demanda Franz.\\n\\n--Avez-vous la somme qu'on vous a demandée?\\n\\n--Oui, moins huit cents piastres.»\\n\\nLe comte alla à son secrétaire, l'ouvrit, et faisant glisser un tiroir\\nplein d'or:\\n\\n«J'espère, dit-il à Franz, que vous ne me ferez pas l'injure de vous\\nadresser à un autre qu'à moi?\\n\\n--Vous voyez, au contraire, que je suis venu droit à vous, dit Franz.\\n\\n--Et je vous en remercie; prenez.»\\n\\nEt il fit signe à Franz de puiser dans le tiroir.\\n\\n«Est-il bien nécessaire d'envoyer cette somme à Luigi Vampa? demanda le\\njeune homme en regardant à son tour fixement le comte.\\n\\n--Dame! fit-il, jugez-en vous-même, le post-scriptum est précis.\\n\\n--Il me semble que si vous vous donniez la peine de chercher, vous\\ntrouveriez quelque moyen qui simplifierait beaucoup la négociation, dit\\nFranz.\\n\\n--Et lequel? demanda le comte étonné.\\n\\n--Par exemple, si nous allions trouver Luigi Vampa ensemble, je suis sûr\\nqu'il ne vous refuserait pas la liberté d'Albert.\\n\\n--À moi? et quelle influence voulez-vous que j'aie sur ce bandit?\\n\\n--Ne venez-vous pas de lui rendre un de ces services qui ne s'oublient\\npoint?\\n\\n--Et lequel?\\n\\n--Ne venez-vous pas de sauver la vie à Peppino?\\n\\n--Ah! ah! qui vous a dit cela?\\n\\n--Que vous importe? Je le sais.»\\n\\nLe comte resta un instant muet et les sourcils froncés.\\n\\n«Et si j'allais trouver Vampa, vous m'accompagneriez?\\n\\n--Si ma compagnie ne vous était pas trop désagréable.\\n\\n--Eh bien, soit; le temps est beau, une promenade dans la campagne de\\nRome ne peut que nous faire du bien.\\n\\n--Faut-il prendre des armes?\\n\\n--Pour quoi faire?\\n\\n--De l'argent?\\n\\n--C'est inutile. Où est l'homme qui a apporté ce billet?\\n\\n--Dans la rue.\\n\\n--Il attend la réponse?\\n\\n--Oui.\\n\\n--Il faut un peu savoir où nous allons; je vais l'appeler.\\n\\n--Inutile, il n'a pas voulu monter.\\n\\n--Chez vous, peut-être; mais, chez moi, il ne fera pas de difficultés.»\\n\\nLe comte alla à la fenêtre du cabinet qui donnait sur la rue, et siffla\\nd'une certaine façon. L'homme au manteau se détacha de la muraille et\\ns'avança jusqu'au milieu de la rue.\\n\\n«_Salite!»_ dit le comte, du ton dont il aurait donné un ordre à un\\ndomestique.\\n\\nLe messager obéit sans retard, sans hésitation, avec empressement même,\\net, franchissant les quatre marches du perron, entra dans l'hôtel. Cinq\\nsecondes après, il était à la porte du cabinet.\\n\\n«Ah! c'est toi, Peppino!» dit le comte.\\n\\nMais Peppino, au lieu de répondre, se jeta à genoux, saisit la main du\\ncomte et y appliqua ses lèvres à plusieurs reprises.\\n\\n«Ah! ah! dit le comte, tu n'as pas encore oublié que je t'ai sauvé la\\nvie! C'est étrange, il y a pourtant, aujourd'hui huit jours de cela.\\n\\n--Non, Excellence, et je ne l'oublierai jamais, répondit Peppino avec\\nl'accent d'une profonde reconnaissance.\\n\\n--Jamais, c'est bien long! mais enfin c'est déjà beaucoup que tu le\\ncroies. Relève-toi et réponds.»\\n\\nPeppino jeta un coup d'oeil inquiet sur Franz.\\n\\n«Oh! tu peux parler devant Son Excellence, dit-il, c'est un de mes\\namis.\\n\\n«Vous permettez que je vous donne ce titre, dit en français le comte en\\nse tournant du côté de Franz; il est nécessaire pour exciter la\\nconfiance de cet homme.\\n\\n--Vous pouvez parler devant moi, reprit Franz, je suis un ami du comte.\\n\\n--À la bonne heure, dit Peppino en se retournant à son tour vers le\\ncomte; que Votre Excellence m'interroge, et je répondrai.\\n\\n--Comment le vicomte Albert est-il tombé entre les mains de Luigi?\\n\\n--Excellence, la calèche du Français a croisé plusieurs fois celle où\\nétait Teresa.\\n\\n--La maîtresse du chef?\\n\\n--Oui. Le Français lui a fait les yeux doux, Teresa s'est amusée à lui\\nrépondre; le Français lui a jeté des bouquets, elle lui en a rendu: tout\\ncela, bien entendu, du consentement du chef, qui était dans la même\\ncalèche.\\n\\n--Comment! s'écria Franz, Luigi Vampa était dans la calèche des\\npaysannes romaines?\\n\\n--C'était lui qui conduisait, déguisé en cocher, répondit Peppino.\\n\\n--Après? demanda le comte.\\n\\n--Eh bien, après, le Français se démasqua; Teresa toujours du\\nconsentement du chef, en fit autant; le Français demanda un rendez-vous,\\nTeresa accorda le rendez-vous demandé; seulement, au lieu de Teresa, ce\\nfut Beppo qui se trouva sur les marches de l'église San-Giacomo.\\n\\n--Comment! interrompit encore Franz, cette paysanne qui lui a arraché\\nson moccoletto?...\\n\\n--C'était un jeune garçon de quinze ans, répondit Peppino; mais il n'y a\\npas de honte pour votre ami à y avoir été pris; Beppo en a attrapé bien\\nd'autres, allez.\\n\\n--Et Beppo l'a conduit hors des murs? dit le comte.\\n\\n--Justement, une calèche attendait au bout de la via Macello; Beppo est\\nmonté dedans en invitant le Français à le suivre; il ne se l'est pas\\nfait dire deux fois. Il a galamment offert la droite à Beppo, et s'est\\nplacé près de lui. Beppo lui a annoncé alors qu'il allait le conduire à\\nune villa située à une lieue de Rome. Le Français a assuré Beppo qu'il\\nétait prêt à le suivre au bout du monde. Aussitôt le cocher a remonté la\\nrue di Ripetta, a gagné la porte San-Paolo; et à deux cents pas dans la\\ncampagne, comme le Français devenait trop entreprenant, ma foi, Beppo\\nlui a mis une paire de pistolets sur la gorge; aussitôt le cocher a\\narrêté ses chevaux, s'est retourné sur son siège et en a fait autant. En\\nmême temps quatre des nôtres, qui étaient cachés sur les bords de\\nl'Almo, se sont élancés aux portières. Le Français avait bonne envie de\\nse détendre, il a même un peu étranglé Beppo, à ce que j'ai entendu\\ndire, mais il n'y avait rien à faire contre cinq hommes armés. Il a bien\\nfallu se rendre; on l'a fait descendre de voiture, on a suivi les bords\\nde la petite rivière, et on l'a conduit à Teresa et à Luigi, qui\\nl'attendaient dans les catacombes de Saint-Sébastien.\\n\\n--Eh bien, mais, dit le comte en se tournant du côté de Franz, il me\\nsemble qu'elle en vaut bien une autre, cette histoire. Qu'en dites-vous,\\nvous qui êtes connaisseur?\\n\\n--Je dis que je la trouverais fort drôle, répondit Franz, si elle était\\narrivée à un autre qu'à ce pauvre Albert.\\n\\n--Le fait est, dit le comte, que si vous ne m'aviez pas trouvé là,\\nc'était une bonne fortune qui coûtait un peu cher à votre ami; mais,\\nrassurez-vous, il en sera quitte pour la peur.\\n\\n--Et nous allons toujours le chercher? demanda Franz.\\n\\n--Pardieu! d'autant plus qu'il est dans un endroit fort pittoresque.\\nConnaissez-vous les catacombes de Saint-Sébastien?\\n\\n--Non, je n'y suis jamais descendu, mais je me promettais d'y descendre\\nun jour.\\n\\n--Eh bien, voici l'occasion toute trouvée et il serait difficile d'en\\nrencontrer une autre meilleure. Avez-vous votre voiture?\\n\\n--Non.\\n\\n--Cela ne fait rien; on a l'habitude de m'en tenir une tout attelée,\\nnuit et jour.\\n\\n--Tout attelée?\\n\\n--Oui, je suis un être fort capricieux; il faut vous dire que parfois en\\nme levant, à la fin de mon dîner, au milieu de la nuit, il me prend\\nl'envie de partir pour un point du monde quelconque, et je pars.»\\n\\nLe comte sonna un coup, son valet de chambre parut.\\n\\n«Faites sortir la voiture de la remise, dit-il, et ôtez en les pistolets\\nqui sont dans les poches, il est inutile de réveiller le cocher, Ali\\nconduira.»\\n\\nAu bout d'un instant on entendit le bruit de la voiture qui s'arrêtait\\ndevant la porte.\\n\\nLe comte tira sa montre.\\n\\n«Minuit et demi, dit-il, nous aurions pu partir d'ici à cinq heures du\\nmatin et arriver encore à temps; mais peut-être ce retard aurait-il fait\\npasser une mauvaise nuit à votre compagnon, il vaut donc mieux aller\\ntout courant le tirer des mains des infidèles. Êtes-vous toujours\\ndécidé à m'accompagner?\\n\\n--Plus que jamais.\\n\\n--Eh bien, venez alors.»\\n\\nFranz et le comte sortirent, suivis de Peppino.\\n\\nÀ la porte, ils trouvèrent la voiture. Ali était sur le siège. Franz\\nreconnut l'esclave muet de la grotte de Monte-Cristo.\\n\\nFranz et le comte montèrent dans la voiture, qui était un coupé, Peppino\\nse plaça près d'Ali, et l'on partit au galop. Ali avait reçu des ordres\\nd'avance, car il prit la rue du Cours, traversa le Campo Vaccino,\\nremonta la strada San-Gregorio et arriva à la porte Saint-Sébastien; là\\nle concierge voulut faire quelques difficultés, mais le comte de\\nMonte-Cristo présenta une autorisation du gouverneur de Rome d'entrer\\ndans la ville et d'en sortir à toute heure du jour et de la nuit; la\\nherse fut donc levée, le concierge reçut un louis pour sa peine, et l'on\\npassa.\\n\\nLa route que suivait la voiture était l'ancienne voie Appienne, toute\\nbordée de tombeaux. De temps en temps, au clair de la lune qui\\ncommençait à se lever, il semblait à Franz voir comme une sentinelle se\\ndétacher d'une ruine, mais aussitôt, à un signe échangé entre Peppino et\\ncette sentinelle, elle rentrait dans l'ombre et disparaissait.\\n\\nUn peu avant le cirque de Caracalla, la voiture s'arrêta, Peppino vint\\nouvrir la portière, et le comte et Franz descendirent.\\n\\n«Dans dix minutes, dit le comte à son compagnon, nous serons arrivés.»\\n\\nPuis il prit Peppino à part, lui donna un ordre tout bas, et Peppino\\npartit après s'être muni d'une torche que l'on tira du coffre du coupé.\\n\\nCinq minutes s'écoulèrent encore, pendant lesquelles Franz vit le berger\\ns'enfoncer par un petit sentier au milieu des mouvements de terrain qui\\nforment le sol convulsionné de la plaine de Rome, et disparaître dans\\nces hautes herbes rougeâtres qui semblent la crinière hérissée de\\nquelque lion gigantesque.\\n\\n«Maintenant, dit le comte, suivons-le.»\\n\\nFranz et le comte s'engagèrent à leur tour dans le même sentier qui, au\\nbout de cent pas, les conduisit par une pente inclinée au fond d'une\\npetite vallée.\\n\\nBientôt on aperçut deux hommes causant dans l'ombre.\\n\\n«Devons-nous continuer d'avancer? demanda Franz au comte, ou faut-il\\nattendre?\\n\\n--Marchons; Peppino doit avoir prévenu la sentinelle de notre arrivée.»\\n\\nEn effet, l'un de ces deux hommes était Peppino, l'autre était un\\nbandit placé en vedette.\\n\\nFranz et le comte s'approchèrent; le bandit salua.\\n\\n«Excellence, dit Peppino en s'adressant au comte, si vous voulez me\\nsuivre, l'ouverture des catacombes est à deux pas d'ici.\\n\\n--C'est bien, dit le comte, marche devant.»\\n\\nEn effet, derrière un massif de buissons et au milieu de quelques roches\\ns'offrait une ouverture par laquelle un homme pouvait à peine passer.\\n\\nPeppino se glissa le premier par cette gerçure, mais à peine eut-il\\nfait quelques pas que le passage souterrain s'élargit. Alors il\\ns'arrêta, alluma sa torche et se retourna pour voir s'il était suivi.\\n\\nLe comte s'était engagé le premier dans une espèce de soupirail, et\\nFranz venait après lui.\\n\\nLe terrain s'enfonçait par une pente douce et s'élargissait à mesure que\\nl'on avançait; mais cependant Franz et le comte étaient encore forcés de\\nmarcher courbés et eussent eu peine à passer deux de front. Ils firent\\nencore cent cinquante pas ainsi, puis ils furent arrêtés par le cri de:\\n_Qui vive_?\\n\\nEn même temps ils virent au milieu de l'obscurité briller sur le canon\\nd'une carabine le reflet de leur propre torche.\\n\\n«_Ami_!» dit Peppino.\\n\\nEt il s'avança seul et dit quelques mots à voix basse à cette seconde\\nsentinelle, qui, comme la première, salua en faisant signe aux visiteurs\\nnocturnes qu'ils pouvaient continuer leur chemin.\\n\\nDerrière la sentinelle était un escalier d'une vingtaine de marches;\\nFranz et le comte descendirent les vingt marches, et se trouvèrent dans\\nune espèce de carrefour mortuaire. Cinq routes divergeaient comme les\\nrayons d'une étoile, et les parois des murailles creusées de niches\\nsuperposées ayant la forme de cercueils, indiquaient que l'on était\\nentré enfin dans les catacombes.\\n\\nDans l'une de ces cavités, dont il était impossible de distinguer\\nl'étendue, on voyait, le jour, quelques reflets de lumière.\\n\\nLe comte posa la main sur l'épaule de Franz.\\n\\n«Voulez-vous voir un camp de bandits au repos? lui dit-il.\\n\\n--Certainement, répondit Franz.\\n\\n--Eh bien, venez avec moi.... Peppino, éteins la torche.»\\n\\nPeppino obéit, et Franz et le comte se trouvèrent dans la plus profonde\\nobscurité; seulement, à cinquante pas à peu près en avant d'eux,\\ncontinuèrent de danser le long des murailles quelques lueurs rougeâtres\\ndevenues encore plus visibles depuis que Peppino avait éteint sa torche.\\n\\nIls avancèrent silencieusement, le comte guidant Franz comme s'il avait\\neu cette singulière faculté de voir dans les ténèbres. Au reste, Franz\\nlui-même distinguait plus facilement son chemin à mesure qu'il\\ns'approchait de ces reflets qui leur servaient de guides.\\n\\nTrois arcades, dont celle du milieu servait de porte, leur donnaient\\npassage.\\n\\nCes arcades s'ouvraient d'un côté sur le corridor où étaient le comte\\net Franz, et de l'autre sur une grande chambre carrée tout entourée de\\nniches pareilles à celles dont nous avons déjà parlé. Au milieu de cette\\nchambre s'élevaient quatre pierres qui autrefois avaient servi d'autel,\\ncomme l'indiquait la croix qui les surmontait encore.\\n\\nUne seule lampe, posée sur un fût de colonne, éclairait d'une lumière\\npâle et vacillante l'étrange scène qui s'offrait aux yeux des deux\\nvisiteurs cachés dans l'ombre.\\n\\nUn homme était assis, le coude appuyé sur cette colonne, et lisait,\\ntournant le dos aux arcades par l'ouverture desquelles les nouveaux\\narrivés le regardaient.\\n\\nC'était le chef de la bande, Luigi Vampa.\\n\\nTout autour de lui, groupés selon leur caprice, couchés dans leurs\\nmanteaux ou adossés à une espèce de banc de pierre qui régnait tout\\nautour du columbarium, on distinguait une vingtaine de brigands; chacun\\navait sa carabine à portée de la main.\\n\\nAu fond, silencieuse, à peine visible et pareille à une ombre, une\\nsentinelle se promenait de long en large devant une espèce d'ouverture\\nqu'on ne distinguait que parce que les ténèbres semblaient plus épaisses\\nen cet endroit.\\n\\nLorsque le comte crut que Franz avait suffisamment réjoui ses regards de\\nce pittoresque tableau, il porta le doigt à ses lèvres pour lui\\nrecommander le silence, et montant les trois marches qui conduisaient du\\ncorridor au columbarium, il entra dans la chambre par l'arcade du\\nmilieu et s'avança vers Vampa, qui était si profondément plongé dans sa\\nlecture qu'il n'entendit point le bruit de ses pas.\\n\\n«Qui vive?» cria la sentinelle moins préoccupée, et qui vit à la lueur\\nde la lampe une espèce d'ombre qui grandissait derrière son chef.\\n\\nÀ ce cri Vampa se leva vivement, tirant du même coup un pistolet de sa\\nceinture.\\n\\nEn un instant tous les bandits furent sur pied, et vingt canons de\\ncarabine se dirigèrent sur le comte.\\n\\n«Eh bien, dit tranquillement celui-ci d'une voix parfaitement calme et\\nsans qu'un seul muscle de son visage bougeât; eh bien, mon cher Vampa,\\nil me semble que voilà bien des frais pour recevoir un ami!\\n\\n--Armes bas!» cria le chef en faisant un signe impératif d'une main,\\ntandis que de l'autre il ôtait respectueusement son chapeau.\\n\\nPuis se retournant vers le singulier personnage qui dominait toute cette\\nscène:\\n\\n«Pardon, monsieur le comte, lui dit-il, mais j'étais si loin de\\nm'attendre à l'honneur de votre visite, que je ne vous ai pas reconnu.\\n\\n--Il paraît que vous avez la mémoire courte en toute chose, Vampa, dit\\nle comte, et que non seulement vous oubliez le visage des gens, mais\\nencore les conditions faites avec eux.\\n\\n--Et quelles conditions ai-je donc oubliées, monsieur le comte? demanda\\nle bandit en homme qui, s'il a commis une erreur, ne demande pas mieux\\nque de la réparer.\\n\\n--N'a-t-il pas été convenu, dit le comte, que non seulement ma personne,\\nmais encore celle de mes amis, vous seraient sacrées?\\n\\n--Et en quoi ai-je manqué au traité, Excellence?\\n\\n--Vous avez enlevé ce soir et vous avez transporté ici le vicomte\\nAlbert de Morcerf; eh bien, continua le comte avec un accent qui fit\\nfrissonner Franz, ce jeune homme est _de mes amis_, ce jeune homme loge\\ndans le même hôtel que moi, ce jeune homme a fait Corso pendant huit\\njours dans ma propre calèche, et cependant, je vous le répète, vous\\nl'avez enlevé, vous l'avez transporté ici, et, ajouta le comte en tirant\\nla lettre de sa poche, vous l'avez mis à rançon comme s'il était le\\npremier venu.\\n\\n--Pourquoi ne m'avez-vous pas prévenu de cela, vous autres? dit le chef\\nen se tournant vers ses hommes, qui reculèrent tous devant son regard;\\npourquoi m'avez-vous exposé ainsi à manquer à ma parole envers un homme\\ncomme M. le comte, qui tient notre vie à tous entre ses mains? Par le\\nsang du Christ! si je croyais qu'un de vous eût su que le jeune homme\\nétait l'ami de Son Excellence, je lui brûlerais la cervelle de ma propre\\nmain.\\n\\n--Eh bien, dit le comte en se retournant du côté de Franz, je vous avais\\nbien dit qu'il y avait quelque erreur là-dessous.\\n\\n--N'êtes-vous pas seul? demanda Vampa avec inquiétude.\\n\\n--Je suis avec la personne à qui cette lettre était adressée, et à qui\\nj'ai voulu prouver que Luigi Vampa est un homme de parole. Venez,\\nExcellence, dit-il à Franz, voilà Luigi Vampa qui va vous dire lui-même\\nqu'il est désespéré de l'erreur qu'il vient de commettre.»\\n\\nFranz s'approcha; le chef fit quelques pas au-devant de Franz.\\n\\n«Soyez le bienvenu parmi nous, Excellence, lui dit-il; vous avez\\nentendu ce que vient de dire le comte, et ce que je lui ai répondu:\\nj'ajouterai que je ne voudrais pas, pour les quatre mille piastres\\nauxquelles j'avais fixé la rançon de votre ami, que pareille chose fût\\narrivée.\\n\\n--Mais, dit Franz en regardant tout autour de lui avec inquiétude, où\\ndonc est le prisonnier? je ne le vois pas.\\n\\n--Il ne lui est rien arrivé, j'espère! demanda le comte en fronçant le\\nsourcil.\\n\\n--Le prisonnier est là, dit Vampa en montrant de la main l'enfoncement\\ndevant lequel se promenait le bandit en faction, et je vais lui annoncer\\nmoi-même qu'il est libre.»\\n\\nLe chef s'avança vers l'endroit désigné par lui comme servant de prison\\nà Albert, et Franz et le comte le suivirent.\\n\\n«Que fait le prisonnier? demanda Vampa à la sentinelle.\\n\\n--Ma foi, capitaine, répondit celle-ci, je n'en sais rien; depuis plus\\nd'une heure, je ne l'ai pas entendu remuer.\\n\\n--Venez, Excellence!» dit Vampa.\\n\\nLe comte et Franz montèrent sept ou huit marches, toujours précédés par\\nle chef, qui tira un verrou et poussa une porte.\\n\\nAlors, à la lueur d'une lampe pareille à celle qui éclairait le\\ncolumbarium, on put voir Albert, enveloppé d'un manteau que lui avait\\nprêté un des bandits, couché dans un coin et dormant du plus profond\\nsommeil.\\n\\n«Allons! dit le comte souriant de ce sourire qui lui était particulier,\\npas mal pour un homme qui devait être fusillé à sept heures du matin.»\\n\\nVampa regardait Albert endormi avec une certaine admiration; on voyait\\nqu'il n'était pas insensible à cette preuve de courage.\\n\\n«Vous avez raison, monsieur le comte, dit-il, cet homme doit être de vos\\namis.»\\n\\nPuis s'approchant d'Albert et lui touchant l'épaule:\\n\\n«Excellence! dit-il, vous plaît-il de vous éveiller?»\\n\\nAlbert étendit les bras, se frotta les paupières et ouvrit les yeux.\\n\\n«Ah! ah! dit-il, c'est vous, capitaine! pardieu, vous auriez bien dû me\\nlaisser dormir; je faisais un rêve charmant: je rêvais que je dansais le\\ngalop chez Torlonia avec la comtesse G...!»\\n\\nIl tira sa montre, qu'il avait gardée pour juger lui-même le temps\\nécoulé.\\n\\n«Une heure et demie du matin! dit-il, mais pourquoi diable\\nm'éveillez-vous à cette heure-ci?\\n\\n--Pour vous dire que vous êtes libre, Excellence.\\n\\n--Mon cher, reprit Albert avec une liberté d'esprit parfaite, retenez\\nbien à l'avenir cette maxime de Napoléon le Grand: «Ne m'éveillez que\\npour les mauvaises nouvelles.» Si vous m'aviez laissé dormir, j'achevais\\nmon galop, et je vous en aurais été reconnaissant toute ma vie.... On a\\ndonc payé ma rançon?\\n\\n--Non, Excellence.\\n\\n--Eh bien, alors, comment suis-je libre?\\n\\n--Quelqu'un, à qui je n'ai rien à refuser, est venu vous réclamer.\\n\\n--Jusqu'ici?\\n\\n--Jusqu'ici.\\n\\n--Ah! pardieu, ce quelqu'un-là est bien aimable!»\\n\\nAlbert regarda tout autour de lui et aperçut Franz.\\n\\n«Comment, lui dit-il, c'est vous, mon cher Franz, qui poussez le\\ndévouement jusque-là?\\n\\n--Non, pas moi, répondit Franz, mais notre voisin, M. le comte de\\nMonte-Cristo.\\n\\n--Ah pardieu! monsieur le comte, dit gaiement Albert en rajustant sa\\ncravate et ses manchettes, vous êtes un homme véritablement précieux, et\\nj'espère que vous me regarderez comme votre éternel obligé, d'abord pour\\nl'affaire de la voiture, ensuite pour celle-ci!» et il tendit la main au\\ncomte, qui frissonna au moment de lui donner la sienne, mais qui\\ncependant la lui donna.\\n\\nLe bandit regardait toute cette scène d'un air stupéfait; il était\\névidemment habitué à voir ses prisonniers trembler devant lui, et voilà\\nqu'il y en avait un dont l'humeur railleuse n'avait subi aucune\\naltération: quant à Franz, il était enchanté qu'Albert eût soutenu, même\\nvis-à-vis d'un bandit, l'honneur national.\\n\\n«Mon cher Albert, lui dit-il, si vous voulez vous hâter, nous aurons\\nencore le temps d'aller finir la nuit chez Torlonia; vous prendrez votre\\ngalop où vous l'avez interrompu, de sorte que vous ne garderez aucune\\nrancune au seigneur Luigi, qui s'est véritablement, dans toute cette\\naffaire, conduit en galant homme.\\n\\n--Ah! vraiment, dit-il, vous avez raison, et nous pourrons y être à deux\\nheures. Seigneur Luigi, continua Albert, y a-t-il quelque autre\\nformalité à remplir pour prendre congé de Votre Excellence?\\n\\n--Aucune, monsieur, répondit le bandit, et vous êtes libre comme l'air.\\n\\n--En ce cas, bonne et joyeuse vie; venez, messieurs, venez!\\n\\nEt Albert, suivi de Franz et du comte, descendit l'escalier et traversa\\nla grande salle carrée; tous les bandits étaient debout et le chapeau à\\nla main.\\n\\n«Peppino, dit le chef, donne-moi la torche.\\n\\n--Eh bien, que faites-vous donc? demanda le comte.\\n\\n--Je vous reconduis, dit le capitaine; c'est bien le moindre honneur que\\nje puisse rendre à Votre Excellence.»\\n\\nEt prenant la torche allumée des mains du pâtre, il marcha devant ses\\nhôtes, non pas comme un valet qui accomplit une oeuvre de servilité,\\nmais comme un roi qui précède des ambassadeurs.\\n\\nArrivé à la porte il s'inclina.\\n\\n«Et maintenant, monsieur le comte, dit-il, je vous renouvelle mes\\nexcuses, et j'espère que vous ne me gardez aucun ressentiment de ce qui\\nvient d'arriver?\\n\\n--Non, mon cher Vampa, dit le comte; d'ailleurs vous rachetez vos\\nerreurs d'une façon si galante, qu'on est presque tenté de vous savoir\\ngré de les avoir commises.\\n\\n--Messieurs! reprit le chef en se retournant du côté des jeunes gens,\\npeut-être l'offre ne vous paraîtra-t-elle pas bien attrayante; mais,\\ns'il vous prenait jamais envie de me faire une seconde visite, partout\\noù je serai vous serez les bienvenus.»\\n\\nFranz et Albert saluèrent. Le comte sortit le premier, Albert ensuite,\\nFranz restait le dernier.\\n\\n«Votre Excellence a quelque chose à me demander? dit Vampa en souriant.\\n\\n--Oui, je l'avoue, répondit Franz, je serais curieux de savoir quel\\nétait l'ouvrage que vous lisiez avec tant d'attention quand nous sommes\\narrivés.\\n\\n--Les _Commentaires de César_, dit le bandit, c'est mon livre de\\nprédilection.\\n\\n--Eh bien, ne venez-vous pas? demanda Albert.\\n\\n--Si fait, répondit Franz, me voilà!»\\n\\nEt il sortit à son tour du soupirail.\\n\\nOn fit quelques pas dans la plaine.\\n\\n«Ah! pardon! dit Albert en revenant en arrière, voulez-vous permettre,\\ncapitaine?\\n\\nEt il alluma son cigare à la torche de Vampa.\\n\\n«Maintenant, monsieur le comte, dit-il, la plus grande diligence\\npossible! je tiens énormément à aller finir ma nuit chez le duc de\\nBracciano.»\\n\\nOn retrouva la voiture où on l'avait laissée; le comte dit un seul mot\\narabe à Ali, et les chevaux partirent à fond de train.\\n\\nIl était deux heures juste à la montre d'Albert quand les deux amis\\nrentrèrent dans la salle de danse.\\n\\nLeur retour fit événement; mais, comme ils entraient ensemble, toutes\\nles inquiétudes que l'on avait pu concevoir sur Albert cessèrent à\\nl'instant même.\\n\\n«Madame, dit le vicomte de Morcerf en s'avançant vers la comtesse, hier\\nvous avez eu la bonté de me promettre un galop, je viens un peu tard\\nréclamer cette gracieuse promesse; mais voilà mon ami, dont vous\\nconnaissez la véracité, qui vous affirmera qu'il n'y a pas de ma faute.»\\n\\nEt comme en ce moment la musique donnait le signal de la valse, Albert\\npassa son bras autour de la taille de la comtesse et disparut avec elle\\ndans le tourbillon des danseurs.\\n\\nPendant ce temps Franz songeait au singulier frissonnement qui avait\\npassé par tout le corps du comte de Monte-Cristo au moment où il avait\\nété en quelque sorte forcé de donner la main à Albert.\",\n",
       " 'XXXVIII': \"Le lendemain, en se levant, le premier mot d'Albert fut pour proposer à\\nFranz d'aller faire une visite au comte; il l'avait déjà remercié la\\nveille, mais il comprenait qu'un service comme celui qu'il lui avait\\nrendu valait bien deux remerciements.\\n\\nFranz, qu'un attrait mêlé de terreur attirait vers le comte de\\nMonte-Cristo, ne voulut pas le laisser aller seul chez cet homme et\\nl'accompagna; tous deux furent introduits dans le salon: cinq minutes\\naprès, le comte parut.\\n\\n«Monsieur le comte, lui dit Albert en allant à lui, permettez-moi de\\nvous répéter ce matin ce que je vous ai mal dit hier: c'est que je\\nn'oublierai jamais dans quelle circonstance vous m'êtes venu en aide, et\\nque je me souviendrai toujours que je vous dois la vie ou à peu près.\\n\\n--Mon cher voisin, répondit le comte en riant, vous vous exagérez vos\\nobligations envers moi. Vous me devez une petite économie d'une\\nvingtaine de mille francs sur votre budget de voyage et voilà tout; vous\\nvoyez bien que ce n'est pas la peine d'en parler. De votre côté,\\najouta-t-il, recevez tous mes compliments, vous avez été adorable de\\nsans-gêne et de laisser-aller.\\n\\n--Que voulez-vous, comte, dit Albert; je me suis figuré que je m'étais\\nfait une mauvaise querelle et qu'un duel s'en était suivi, et j'ai voulu\\nfaire comprendre une chose à ces bandits: c'est qu'on se bat dans tous\\nles pays du monde, mais qu'il n'y a que les Français qui se battent en\\nriant. Néanmoins, comme mon obligation vis-à-vis de vous n'en est pas\\nmoins grande, je viens vous demander si, par moi, par mes amis et par\\nmes connaissances, je ne pourrais pas vous être bon à quelque chose. Mon\\npère, le comte de Morcerf, qui est d'origine espagnole, a une haute\\nposition en France et en Espagne, je viens me mettre, moi et tous les\\ngens qui m'aiment, à votre disposition.\\n\\n--Eh bien, dit le comte, je vous avoue, monsieur de Morcerf, que\\nj'attendais votre offre et que je l'accepte de grand coeur. J'avais\\ndéjà jeté mon dévolu sur vous pour vous demander un grand service.\\n\\n--Lequel?\\n\\n--Je n'ai jamais été à Paris! je ne connais pas Paris....\\n\\n--Vraiment! s'écria Albert, vous avez pu vivre jusqu'à présent sans voir\\nParis? c'est incroyable!\\n\\n--C'est ainsi, cependant; mais je sens comme vous qu'une plus longue\\nignorance de la capitale du monde intelligent est chose impossible. Il y\\na plus: peut-être même aurais-je fait ce voyage indispensable depuis\\nlongtemps, si j'avais connu quelqu'un qui pût m'introduire dans ce monde\\noù je n'avais aucune relation.\\n\\n--Oh! un homme comme vous! s'écria Albert.\\n\\n--Vous êtes bien bon, mais comme je ne me reconnais à moi-même d'autre\\nmérite que de pouvoir faire concurrence comme millionnaire à M. Aguado\\nou à M. Rothschild, et que je ne vais pas à Paris pour jouer à la\\nBourse, cette petite circonstance m'a retenu. Maintenant votre offre me\\ndécide. Voyons, vous engagez-vous, mon cher monsieur de Morcerf (le\\ncomte accompagna ces mots d'un singulier sourire), vous engagez-vous,\\nlorsque j'irai en France, à m'ouvrir les portes de ce monde où je serai\\naussi étranger qu'un Huron ou qu'un Cochinchinois?\\n\\n--Oh! quant à cela, monsieur le comte, à merveille et de grand coeur!\\nrépondit Albert; et d'autant plus volontiers (mon cher Franz, ne vous\\nmoquez pas trop de moi!) que je suis rappelé à Paris par une lettre que\\nje reçois ce matin même et où il est question pour moi d'une alliance\\navec une maison fort agréable et qui a les meilleures relations dans le\\nmonde parisien.\\n\\n--Alliance par mariage? dit Franz en riant.\\n\\n--Oh! mon Dieu, oui! Ainsi, quand vous reviendrez à Paris vous me\\ntrouverez homme posé et peut-être père de famille. Cela ira bien à ma\\ngravité naturelle, n'est-ce pas? En tout cas, comte, je vous le répète,\\nmoi et les miens sommes à vous corps et âme.\\n\\n--J'accepte, dit le comte, car je vous jure qu'il ne me manquait que\\ncette occasion pour réaliser des projets que je rumine depuis\\nlongtemps.»\\n\\nFranz ne douta point un instant que ces projets ne fussent ceux dont le\\ncomte avait laissé échapper un mot dans la grotte de Monte-Cristo, et il\\nregarda le comte pendant qu'il disait ces paroles pour essayer de saisir\\nsur sa physionomie quelque révélation de ces projets qui le conduisaient\\nà Paris; mais il était bien difficile de pénétrer dans l'âme de cet\\nhomme, surtout lorsqu'il la voilait avec un sourire.\\n\\n«Mais, voyons, comte, reprit Albert enchanté d'avoir à produire un homme\\ncomme Monte-Cristo, n'est-ce pas là un de ces projets en l'air, comme on\\nen fait mille en voyage, et qui, bâtis sur du sable, sont emportés au\\npremier souffle du vent?\\n\\n--Non, d'honneur, dit le comte; je veux aller à Paris, il faut que j'y\\naille.\\n\\n--Et quand cela?\\n\\n--Mais quand y serez-vous vous-même?\\n\\n--Moi, dit Albert; oh! mon Dieu! dans quinze jours ou trois semaines au\\nplus tard; le temps de revenir.\\n\\n--Eh bien, dit le comte, je vous donne trois mois; vous voyez que je\\nvous fais la mesure large.\\n\\n--Et dans trois mois, s'écria Albert avec joie, vous venez frapper à ma\\nporte?\\n\\n--Voulez-vous un rendez-vous jour pour jour, heure pour heure? dit le\\ncomte, je vous préviens que je suis d'une exactitude désespérante.\\n\\n--Jour pour jour, heure pour heure, dit Albert; cela me va à merveille.\\n\\n--Eh bien, soit. Il étendit la main vers un calendrier suspendu près de\\nla glace. Nous sommes aujourd'hui, dit-il, le 21 février (il tira sa\\nmontre); il est dix heures et demie du matin. Voulez-vous m'attendre le\\n21 mai prochain, à dix heures et demie du matin?\\n\\n--À merveille! dit Albert, le déjeuner sera prêt.\\n\\n--Vous demeurez?\\n\\n--Rue du Helder, n° 27.\\n\\n--Vous êtes chez vous en garçon, je ne vous gênerai pas?\\n\\n--J'habite dans l'hôtel de mon père, mais un pavillon au fond de la cour\\nentièrement séparé.\\n\\n--Bien.»\\n\\nLe comte prit ses tablettes et écrivit: «Rue du Helder, n° 27, 21 mai,\\nà dix heures et demie du matin.»\\n\\n«Et maintenant, dit le comte en remettant ses tablettes dans sa poche,\\nsoyez tranquille, l'aiguille de votre pendule ne sera pas plus exacte\\nque moi.\\n\\n--Je vous reverrai avant mon départ? demanda Albert.\\n\\n--C'est selon: quand partez-vous?\\n\\n--Je pars demain, à cinq heures du soir.\\n\\n--En ce cas, je vous dis adieu. J'ai affaire à Naples et ne serai de\\nretour ici que samedi soir ou dimanche matin. Et vous, demanda le comte\\nà Franz, partez-vous aussi, monsieur le baron?\\n\\n--Oui.\\n\\n--Pour la France?\\n\\n--Non, pour Venise. Je reste encore un an ou deux en Italie.\\n\\n--Nous ne nous verrons donc pas à Paris?\\n\\n--Je crains de ne pas avoir cet honneur.\\n\\n--Allons, messieurs, bon voyage», dit le comte aux deux amis en leur\\ntendant à chacun une main.\\n\\nC'était la première fois que Franz touchait la main de cet homme; il\\ntressaillit, car elle était glacée comme celle d'un mort.\\n\\n«Une dernière fois, dit Albert, c'est bien arrêté, sur parole d'honneur,\\nn'est-ce pas? rue du Helder, n° 27, le 21 mai, à dix heures et demie du\\nmatin?\\n\\n--Le 21 mai, à dix heures et demie du matin, rue du Helder, n° 27»,\\nreprit le comte.\\n\\nSur quoi les deux jeunes gens saluèrent le comte et sortirent.\\n\\n«Qu'avez-vous donc? dit en rentrant chez lui Albert à Franz, vous avez\\nl'air tout soucieux.\\n\\n--Oui, dit Franz, je vous l'avoue, le comte est un homme singulier, et\\nje vois avec inquiétude ce rendez-vous qu'il vous a donné à Paris.\\n\\n--Ce rendez-vous... avec inquiétude! Ah çà! mais êtes-vous fou, mon cher\\nFranz? s'écria Albert.\\n\\n--Que voulez-vous, dit Franz, fou ou non, c'est ainsi.\\n\\n--Écoutez, reprit Albert, et je suis bien aise que l'occasion se\\nprésente de vous dire cela, mais je vous ai toujours trouvé assez froid\\npour le comte, que, de son côté, j'ai toujours trouvé parfait, au\\ncontraire, pour nous. Avez-vous quelque chose de particulier contre lui?\\n\\n\\n--Peut-être.\\n\\n--L'aviez-vous vu déjà quelque part avant de le rencontrer ici?\\n\\n--Justement.\\n\\n--Où cela?\\n\\n--Me promettez-vous de ne pas dire un mot de ce que je vais vous\\nraconter?\\n\\n--Je vous le promets.\\n\\n--Parole d'honneur?\\n\\n--Parole d'honneur.\\n\\n--C'est bien. Écoutez donc.\\n\\nEt alors Franz raconta à Albert son excursion à l'île de Monte-Cristo,\\ncomment il y avait trouvé un équipage de contrebandiers, et au milieu de\\ncet équipage deux bandits corses. Il s'appesantit sur toutes les\\ncirconstances de l'hospitalité féerique que le comte lui avait donnée\\ndans sa grotte des _Mille et une Nuits_; il lui raconta le souper, le\\nhaschich, les statues, la réalité et le rêve, et comment à son réveil il\\nne restait plus comme preuve et comme souvenir de tous ces événements\\nque ce petit yacht, faisant à l'horizon voile pour Porto-Vecchio.\\n\\nPuis il passa à Rome, à la nuit du Colisée, à la conversation qu'il\\navait entendue entre lui et Vampa, conversation relative à Peppino, et\\ndans laquelle le comte avait promis d'obtenir la grâce du bandit,\\npromesse qu'il avait si bien tenue, ainsi que nos lecteurs ont pu en\\njuger.\\n\\nEnfin, il en arriva à l'aventure de la nuit précédente, à l'embarras où\\nil s'était trouvé en voyant qu'il lui manquait pour compléter la somme\\nsix ou sept cents piastres; enfin à l'idée qu'il avait eue de s'adresser\\nau comte, idée qui avait eu à la fois un résultat si pittoresque et si\\nsatisfaisant.\\n\\nAlbert écoutait Franz de toutes ses oreilles.\\n\\n«Eh bien, lui dit-il quand il eut fini, où voyez-vous dans tout cela\\nquelque chose à reprendre? Le comte est voyageur, le comte a un bâtiment\\nà lui, parce qu'il est riche. Allez à Portsmouth ou à Southampton, vous\\nverrez les ports encombrés de yachts appartenant à de riches Anglais qui\\nont la même fantaisie. Pour savoir où s'arrêter dans ses excursions,\\npour ne pas manger cette affreuse cuisine qui nous empoisonne, moi\\ndepuis quatre mois, vous depuis quatre ans pour ne pas coucher dans ces\\nabominables lits où l'on ne peut dormir, il se fait meubler un\\npied-à-terre à Monte-Cristo: quand son pied-à-terre est meublé, il\\ncraint que le gouvernement toscan ne lui donne congé et que ses dépenses\\nne soient perdues, alors il achète l'île et en prend le nom. Mon cher,\\nfouillez dans votre souvenir, et dites-moi combien de gens de votre\\nconnaissance prennent le nom des propriétés qu'ils n'ont jamais eues.\\n\\n--Mais, dit Franz à Albert, les bandits corses qui se trouvent dans son\\néquipage?\\n\\n--Eh bien, qu'y a-t-il d'étonnant à cela? Vous savez mieux que personne,\\nn'est-ce pas, que les bandits corses ne sont pas des voleurs, mais\\npurement et simplement des fugitifs que quelque vendetta a exilés de\\nleur ville ou de leur village; on peut donc les voir sans se\\ncompromettre: quant à moi, je déclare que si jamais je vais en Corse,\\navant de me faire présenter au gouverneur et au préfet, je me fais\\nprésenter aux bandits de Colomba, si toutefois on peut mettre la main\\ndessus; je les trouve charmants.\\n\\n--Mais Vampa et sa troupe, reprit Franz; ceux-là sont des bandits qui\\narrêtent pour voler; vous ne le niez pas, je l'espère. Que dites-vous\\nde l'influence du comte sur de pareils hommes?\\n\\n--Je dirai, mon cher, que, comme selon toute probabilité je dois la vie\\nà cette influence, ce n'est point à moi à la critiquer de trop près.\\nAinsi donc, au lieu de lui en faire comme vous un crime capital, vous\\ntrouverez bon que je l'excuse, sinon de m'avoir sauvé la vie, ce qui est\\npeut-être un peu exagéré mais du moins de m'avoir épargné quatre mille\\npiastres, qui font bel et bien vingt-quatre mille livres de notre\\nmonnaie, somme à laquelle on ne m'aurait certes pas estimé en France; ce\\nqui prouve, ajouta Albert en riant, que nul n'est prophète en son pays.\\n\\n--Eh bien, voilà justement; de quel pays est le comte? quelle langue\\nparle-t-il? quels sont ses moyens d'existence? d'où lui vient son\\nimmense fortune? quelle a été cette première partie de sa vie\\nmystérieuse et inconnue qui a répandu sur la seconde cette teinte sombre\\net misanthropique? Voilà, à votre place, ce que je voudrais savoir.\\n\\n--Mon cher Franz, reprit Albert, quand en recevant ma lettre vous avez\\nvu que nous avions besoin de l'influence du comte, vous avez été lui\\ndire: «Albert de Morcerf, mon ami, court un danger; aidez-moi à le tirer\\nde ce danger!» n'est-ce pas?\\n\\n--Oui.\\n\\n--Alors, vous a-t-il demandé: «Qu'est-ce que M. Albert de Morcerf? d'où\\nlui vient son nom? d'où lui vient sa fortune? quels sont ses moyens\\nd'existence? quel est son pays? où est-il né?» Vous a-t-il demandé tout\\ncela, dites?\\n\\n--Non, je l'avoue.\\n\\n--Il est venu, voilà tout. Il m'a tiré des mains de M. Vampa; où, malgré\\nmes apparences pleines de désinvolture, comme vous dites, je faisais\\nfort mauvaise figure, je l'avoue. Eh bien, mon cher, quand en échange\\nd'un pareil service il me demande de faire pour lui ce qu'on fait tous\\nles jours pour le premier prince russe ou italien qui passe par Paris,\\nc'est-à-dire de le présenter dans le monde, vous voulez que je lui\\nrefuse cela! Allons donc vous êtes fou.»\\n\\nIl faut dire que, contre l'habitude, toutes les bonnes raisons étaient\\ncette fois du côté d'Albert.\\n\\n«Enfin, reprit Franz avec un soupir, faites comme vous voudrez, mon cher\\nvicomte; car tout ce que vous me dites là est fort spécieux, je l'avoue;\\nmais il n'en est pas moins vrai que le comte de Monte-Cristo est un\\nhomme étrange.\\n\\n--Le comte de Monte-Cristo est un philanthrope. Il ne vous a pas dit\\ndans quel but il venait à Paris. Eh bien, il vient pour concourir aux\\nprix Montyon; et s'il ne lui faut que ma voix pour qu'il les obtienne,\\net l'influence de ce monsieur si laid qui les fait obtenir, eh bien, je\\nlui donnerai l'une et je lui garantirai l'autre. Sur ce, mon cher Franz,\\nne parlons plus de cela, mettons-nous à table et allons faire une\\ndernière visite à Saint-Pierre.»\\n\\nIl fut fait comme disait Albert, et le lendemain, à cinq heures de\\nl'après-midi, les deux jeunes gens se quittaient, Albert de Morcerf pour\\nrevenir à Paris, Franz d'Épinay pour aller passer une quinzaine de jours\\nà Venise.\\n\\nMais, avant de monter en voiture, Albert remit encore au garçon de\\nl'hôtel, tant il avait peur que son convive ne manquât au rendez-vous,\\nune carte pour le comte de Monte-Cristo, sur laquelle au-dessous de ces\\nmots: «Vicomte Albert de Morcerf», il y avait écrit au crayon:\\n\\n_21 mai, à dix heures et demie du matin, 27, rue du Helder._\",\n",
       " 'XXXIX': \"Dans cette maison de la rue du Helder, où Albert de Morcerf avait donné\\nrendez-vous, à Rome, au comte de Monte-Cristo, tout se préparait dans la\\nmatinée du 21 mai pour faire honneur à la parole du jeune homme.\\n\\nAlbert de Morcerf habitait un pavillon situé à l'angle d'une grande cour\\net faisant face à un autre bâtiment destiné aux communs. Deux fenêtres\\nde ce pavillon seulement donnaient sur la rue, les autres étaient\\npercées, trois sur la cour et deux autres en retour sur le jardin.\\n\\nEntre cette cour et ce jardin s'élevait, bâtie avec le mauvais goût de\\nl'architecture impériale, l'habitation fashionable et vaste du comte et\\nde la comtesse de Morcerf.\\n\\nSur toute la largeur de la propriété régnait, donnant sur la rue, un mur\\nsurmonté, de distance en distance, de vases de fleurs, et coupé au\\nmilieu par une grande grille aux lances dorées, qui servait aux entrées\\nd'apparat; une petite porte presque accolée à la loge du concierge\\ndonnait passage aux gens de service ou aux maîtres entrant ou sortant à\\npied.\\n\\nOn devinait, dans ce choix du pavillon destiné à l'habitation d'Albert,\\nla délicate prévoyance d'une mère qui, ne voulant pas se séparer de son\\nfils, avait cependant compris qu'un jeune homme de l'âge du vicomte\\navait besoin de sa liberté tout entière. On y reconnaissait aussi, d'un\\nautre côté, nous devons le dire, l'intelligent égoïsme du jeune homme,\\népris de cette vie libre et oisive, qui est celle des fils de famille,\\net qu'on lui dorait comme à l'oiseau sa cage.\\n\\nPar les deux fenêtres donnant sur la rue, Albert de Morcerf pouvait\\nfaire ses explorations au-dehors. La vue du dehors est si nécessaire aux\\njeunes gens qui veulent toujours voir le monde traverser leur horizon,\\ncet horizon ne fût-il que celui de la rue! Puis son exploration faite,\\nsi cette exploration paraissait mériter un examen plus approfondi,\\nAlbert de Morcerf pouvait, pour se livrer à ses recherches, sortir par\\nune petite porte faisant pendant à celle que nous avons indiquée près de\\nla loge du portier, et qui mérite une mention particulière.\\n\\nC'était une petite porte qu'on eût dit oubliée de tout le monde depuis\\nle jour où la maison avait été bâtie, et qu'on eût cru condamnée à tout\\njamais, tant elle semblait discrète et poudreuse, mais dont la serrure\\net les gonds, soigneusement huilés, annonçaient une pratique mystérieuse\\net suivie. Cette petite porte sournoise faisait concurrence aux deux\\nautres et se moquait du concierge, à la vigilance et à la juridiction\\nduquel elle échappait, s'ouvrant comme la fameuse porte de la caverne\\ndes _Mille et une Nuits_, comme la Sésame enchantée d'Ali-Baba, au moyen\\nde quelques mots cabalistiques, ou de quelques grattements convenus,\\nprononcés par les plus douces voix ou opérés par les doigts les plus\\neffilés du monde.\\n\\nAu bout d'un corridor vaste et calme, auquel communiquait cette petite\\nporte et qui faisait antichambre, s'ouvrait, à droite, la salle à manger\\nd'Albert donnant sur la cour, et, à gauche, son petit salon donnant sur\\nle jardin. Des massifs, des plantes grimpantes s'élargissant en éventail\\ndevant les fenêtres, cachaient à la cour et au jardin l'intérieur de ces\\ndeux pièces, les seules placées au rez-de-chaussée comme elles\\nl'étaient, où pussent pénétrer les regards indiscrets.\\n\\nAu premier, ces deux pièces se répétaient, enrichies d'une troisième,\\nprise sur l'antichambre. Ces trois pièces étaient un salon, une chambre\\nà coucher et un boudoir.\\n\\nLe salon d'en bas n'était qu'une espèce de divan algérien destiné aux\\nfumeurs.\\n\\nLe boudoir du premier donnait dans la chambre à coucher, et, par une\\nporte invisible, communiquait avec l'escalier. On voit que toutes les\\nmesures de précaution étaient prises.\\n\\nAu-dessus de ce premier étage régnait un vaste atelier, que l'on avait\\nagrandi en jetant bas murailles et cloisons, pandémonium que l'artiste\\ndisputait au dandy. Là se réfugiaient et s'entassaient tous les caprices\\nsuccessifs d'Albert, les cors de chasse, les basses, les flûtes, un\\norchestre complet, car Albert avait eu un instant, non pas le goût, mais\\nla fantaisie de la musique; les chevalets, les palettes, les pastels,\\ncar à la fantaisie de la musique avait succédé la fatuité de la\\npeinture; enfin les fleurets, les gants de boxe, les espadons et les\\ncannes de tout genre; car enfin, suivant les traditions des jeunes gens\\nà la mode de l'époque où nous sommes arrivés, Albert de Morcerf\\ncultivait, avec infiniment plus de persévérance qu'il n'avait fait de la\\nmusique et de la peinture, ces trois arts qui complètent l'éducation\\nléonine, c'est-à-dire l'escrime, la boxe et le bâton, et il recevait\\nsuccessivement dans cette pièce, destinée à tous les exercices du corps,\\nGrisier, Cooks et Charles Leboucher.\\n\\nLe reste des meubles de cette pièce privilégiée étaient de vieux bahuts\\ndu temps de François Ier, bahuts pleins de porcelaines de Chine, de\\nvases du Japon, de faïences de Luca della Robbia et de plats de Bernard\\nde Palissy; d'antiques fauteuils où s'étaient peut-être assis Henri IV\\nou Sully, Louis XIII ou Richelieu, car deux de ces fauteuils, ornés d'un\\nécusson sculpté où brillaient sur l'azur les trois fleurs de lis de\\nFrance surmontées d'une couronne royale, sortaient visiblement des\\ngarde-meubles du Louvre, ou tout au moins de celui de quelque château\\nroyal. Sur ces fauteuils aux fonds sombres et sévères, étaient jetées\\npêle-mêle de riches étoffes aux vives couleurs, teintes au soleil de la\\nPerse ou écloses sous les doigts des femmes de Calcutta ou de\\nChandernagor. Ce que faisaient là ces étoffes, on n'eût pas pu le dire;\\nelles attendaient, en récréant les yeux, une destination inconnue à leur\\npropriétaire lui-même, et, en attendant, elles illuminaient\\nl'appartement de leurs reflets soyeux et dorés.\\n\\nÀ la place la plus apparente se dressait un piano, taillé par Roller et\\nBlanchet dans du bois de rose, piano à la taille de nos salons de\\nLilliputiens, renfermant cependant un orchestre dans son étroite et\\nsonore cavité, et gémissant sous le poids des chefs-d'oeuvre de\\nBeethoven, de Weber, de Mozart, d'Haydn, de Grétry et de Porpora.\\n\\nPuis, partout, le long des murailles, au-dessus des portes, au plafond,\\ndes épées, des poignards, des criks, des masses, des haches, des armures\\ncomplètes dorées, damasquinées, incrustées; des herbiers, des blocs de\\nminéraux, des oiseaux bourrés de crin, ouvrant pour un vol immobile\\nleurs ailes couleur de feu et leur bec qu'ils ne ferment jamais.\\n\\nIl va sans dire que cette pièce était la pièce de prédilection d'Albert.\\n\\n\\nCependant, le jour du rendez-vous, le jeune homme, en demi-toilette,\\navait établi son quartier général dans le petit salon du\\nrez-de-chaussée. Là, sur une table entourée à distance d'un divan large\\net moelleux, tous les tabacs connus, depuis le tabac jaune de\\nPétersbourg, jusqu'au tabac noir du Sinaï, en passant par le maryland,\\nle porto-rico et le latakiéh, resplendissaient dans les pots de faïence\\ncraquelée qu'adorent les Hollandais. À côté d'eux, dans des cases de\\nbois odorant, étaient rangés, par ordre de taille et de qualité, les\\npuros, les régalias, les havanes et les manilles; enfin dans une armoire\\ntout ouverte, une collection de pipes allemandes, de chibouques aux\\nbouquins d'ambre, ornées de corail, et de narguilés incrustés d'or, aux\\nlongs tuyaux de maroquin roulés comme des serpents, attendaient le\\ncaprice ou la sympathie des fumeurs. Albert avait présidé lui-même à\\nl'arrangement ou plutôt au désordre symétrique qu'après le café, les\\nconvives d'un déjeuner moderne aiment à contempler à travers la vapeur\\nqui s'échappe de leur bouche et qui monte au plafond en longues et\\ncapricieuses spirales.\\n\\nÀ dix heures moins un quart, un valet de chambre entra. C'était un petit\\ngroom de quinze ans, ne parlant qu'anglais et répondant au nom de John,\\ntout le domestique de Morcerf. Bien entendu que dans les jours\\nordinaires le cuisinier de l'hôtel était à sa disposition, et que dans\\nles grandes occasions le chasseur du comte l'était également.\\n\\nCe valet de chambre, qui s'appelait Germain et qui jouissait de la\\nconfiance entière de son jeune maître, tenait à la main une liasse de\\njournaux qu'il déposa sur une table, et un paquet de lettres qu'il remit\\nà Albert.\\n\\nAlbert jeta un coup d'oeil distrait sur ces différentes missives, en\\nchoisit deux aux écritures fines et aux enveloppes parfumées, les\\ndécacheta et les lut avec une certaine attention.\\n\\n«Comment sont venues ces lettres? demanda-t-il.\\n\\n--L'une est venue par la poste, l'autre a été apportée par le valet de\\nchambre de Mme Danglars.\\n\\n--Faites dire à Mme Danglars que j'accepte la place qu'elle m'offre dans\\nsa loge.... Attendez donc... puis, dans la journée, vous passerez chez\\nRosa; vous lui direz que j'irai, comme elle m'y invite, souper avec\\nelle en sortant de l'Opéra, et vous lui porterez six bouteilles de vins\\nassortis, de Chypre, de Xérès, de Malaga, et un baril d'huîtres\\nd'Ostende.... Prenez les huîtres chez Borel, et dites surtout que c'est\\npour moi.\\n\\n--À quelle heure monsieur veut-il être servi?\\n\\n--Quelle heure avons-nous?\\n\\n--Dix heures moins un quart.\\n\\n--Eh bien, servez pour dix heures et demie précises. Debray sera\\npeut-être forcé d'aller à son ministère.... Et d'ailleurs... (Albert\\nconsulta ses tablettes), c'est bien l'heure que j'ai indiquée au comte,\\nle 21 mai, à dix heures et demie du matin, et quoique je ne fasse pas\\ngrand fond sur sa promesse, je veux être exact. À propos, savez-vous si\\nMme la comtesse est levée?\\n\\n--Si monsieur le vicomte le désire, je m'en informerai.\\n\\n--Oui... vous lui demanderez une de ses caves à liqueurs, la mienne est\\nincomplète, et vous lui direz que j'aurai l'honneur de passer chez elle\\nvers trois heures, et que je lui fais demander la permission de lui\\nprésenter quelqu'un.»\\n\\nLe valet sorti, Albert se jeta sur le divan, déchira l'enveloppe de deux\\nou trois journaux, regarda les spectacles, fit la grimace en\\nreconnaissant que l'on jouait un opéra et non un ballet, chercha\\nvainement dans les annonces de parfumerie un opiat pour les dents dont\\non lui avait parlé, et rejeta l'une après l'autre les trois feuilles les\\nplus courues de Paris, en murmurant au milieu d'un bâillement prolongé:\\n\\n«En vérité, ces journaux deviennent de plus en plus assommants.»\\n\\nEn ce moment une voiture légère s'arrêta devant la porte, et un instant\\naprès le valet de chambre rentra pour annoncer M. Lucien Debray. Un\\ngrand jeune homme blond, pâle, à l'oeil gris et assuré, aux lèvres\\nminces et froides, à l'habit bleu aux boutons d'or ciselés, à la cravate\\nblanche, au lorgnon d'écaille suspendu par un fil de soie, et que, par\\nun effort du nerf sourcilier et du nerf zygomatique, il parvenait à\\nfixer de temps en temps dans la cavité de son oeil droit, entra sans\\nsourire, sans parler et d'un air demi-officiel.\\n\\n«Bonjour, Lucien.... Bonjour! dit Albert. Ah! vous m'effrayez, mon cher,\\navec votre exactitude! Que dis-je? exactitude! Vous que je n'attendais\\nque le dernier, vous arrivez à dix heures moins cinq minutes, lorsque le\\nrendez-vous définitif n'est qu'à dix heures et demie! C'est miraculeux!\\nLe ministère serait-il renversé, par hasard?\\n\\n--Non, très cher, dit le jeune homme en s'incrustant dans le divan;\\nrassurez-vous, nous chancelons toujours, mais nous ne tombons jamais, et\\nje commence à croire que nous passons tout bonnement à l'inamovibilité,\\nsans compter que les affaires de la Péninsule vont nous consolider tout\\nà fait.\\n\\n--Ah! oui, c'est vrai, vous chassez don Carlos d'Espagne.\\n\\n--Non pas, très cher, ne confondons point, nous le ramenons de l'autre\\ncôté de la frontière de France, et nous lui offrons une hospitalité\\nroyale à Bourges.\\n\\n--À Bourges?\\n\\n--Oui, il n'a pas à se plaindre, que diable! Bourges est la capitale du\\nroi Charles VII. Comment! vous ne saviez pas cela? C'est connu depuis\\nhier de tout Paris, et avant-hier la chose avait déjà transpiré à la\\nBourse, car M. Danglars (je ne sais point par quel moyen cet homme sait\\nles nouvelles en même temps que nous), car M. Danglars a joué à la\\nhausse et a gagné un million.\\n\\n--Et vous, un ruban nouveau, à ce qu'il paraît; car je vois un liséré\\nbleu ajouté à votre brochette?\\n\\n--Heu! ils m'ont envoyé la plaque de Charles III, répondit négligemment\\nDebray.\\n\\n--Allons ne faites donc pas l'indifférent, et avouez que la chose vous a\\nfait plaisir à recevoir.\\n\\n--Ma foi, oui, comme complément de toilette, une plaque fait bien sur un\\nhabit noir boutonné, c'est élégant.\\n\\n--Et, dit Morcerf en souriant, on a l'air du prince de Galles ou du duc\\nde Reichstadt.\\n\\n--Voilà donc pourquoi vous me voyez si matin, très cher.\\n\\n--Parce que vous avez la plaque de Charles III et que vous vouliez\\nm'annoncer cette bonne nouvelle?\\n\\n--Non; parce que j'ai passé la nuit à expédier des lettres: vingt-cinq\\ndépêches diplomatiques. Rentré chez moi ce matin au jour, j'ai voulu\\ndormir; mais le mal de tête m'a pris, et je me suis relevé pour monter à\\ncheval une heure. À Boulogne, l'ennui et la faim m'ont saisi, deux\\nennemis qui vont rarement ensemble, et qui cependant se sont ligués\\ncontre moi: une espèce d'alliance carlos-républicaine; je me suis alors\\nsouvenu que l'on festinait chez vous ce matin, et me voilà: j'ai faim,\\nnourrissez-moi; je m'ennuie, amusez-moi.\\n\\n--C'est mon devoir d'amphitryon, cher ami», dit Albert en sonnant le\\nvalet de chambre, tandis que Lucien faisait sauter, avec le bout de sa\\nbadine à pomme d'or incrustée de turquoise, les journaux dépliés.\\n«Germain, un verre de xérès et un biscuit. En attendant, mon cher\\nLucien, voici des cigares de contrebande, bien entendu; je vous engage à\\nen goûter et à inviter votre ministre à nous en vendre de pareils, au\\nlieu de ces espèces de feuilles de noyer qu'il condamne les bons\\ncitoyens à fumer.\\n\\n--Peste! je m'en garderais bien. Du moment où ils vous viendraient du\\ngouvernement vous n'en voudriez plus et les trouveriez exécrables.\\nD'ailleurs, cela ne regarde point l'intérieur, cela regarde les\\nfinances: adressez-vous à M. Humann, section des contributions\\nindirectes, corridor A, n° 26.\\n\\n--En vérité, dit Albert, vous m'étonnez par l'étendue de vos\\nconnaissances. Mais prenez donc un cigare!\\n\\n--Ah! cher vicomte, dit Lucien en allumant un manille à une bougie rose\\nbrûlant dans un bougeoir de vermeil et en se renversant sur le divan,\\nah! cher vicomte, que vous êtes heureux de n'avoir rien à faire! En\\nvérité, vous ne connaissez pas votre bonheur!\\n\\n--Et que feriez-vous donc, mon cher pacificateur de royaumes, reprit\\nMorcerf avec une légère ironie, si vous ne faisiez rien? Comment!\\nsecrétaire particulier d'un ministre, lancé à la fois dans la grande\\ncabale européenne et dans les petites intrigues de Paris; ayant des\\nrois, et, mieux que cela, des reines à protéger, des partis à réunir,\\ndes élections à diriger; faisant plus de votre cabinet avec votre plume\\net votre télégraphe, que Napoléon ne faisait de ses champs de bataille\\navec son épée et ses victoires; possédant vingt-cinq mille livres de\\nrente en dehors de votre place; un cheval dont Château-Renaud vous a\\noffert quatre cents louis, et que vous n'avez pas voulu donner; un\\ntailleur qui ne vous manque jamais un pantalon; ayant l'Opéra, le\\nJockey-Club et le théâtre des Variétés, vous ne trouvez pas dans tout\\ncela de quoi vous distraire? Eh bien, soit, je vous distrairai, moi.\\n\\n--Comment cela?\\n\\n--En vous faisant faire une connaissance nouvelle.\\n\\n--En homme ou en femme?\\n\\n--En homme.\\n\\n--Oh! j'en connais déjà beaucoup!\\n\\n--Mais vous n'en connaissez pas comme celui dont je vous parle.\\n\\n--D'où vient-il donc? du bout du monde?\\n\\n--De plus loin peut-être.\\n\\n--Ah diable! j'espère qu'il n'apporte pas notre déjeuner?\\n\\n--Non, soyez tranquille, notre déjeuner se confectionne dans les\\ncuisines maternelles. Mais vous avez donc faim?\\n\\n--Oui, je l'avoue, si humiliant que cela soit à dire. Mais j'ai dîné\\nhier chez M. de Villefort; et avez-vous remarqué cela, cher ami? on dîne\\ntrès mal chez tous ces gens du parquet; on dirait toujours qu'ils ont\\ndes remords.\\n\\n--Ah! pardieu, dépréciez les dîners des autres, avec cela qu'on dîne\\nbien chez vos ministres.\\n\\n--Oui, mais nous n'invitons pas les gens comme il faut, au moins; et si\\nnous n'étions pas obligés de faire les honneurs de notre table à\\nquelques croquants qui pensent et surtout qui votent bien, nous nous\\ngarderions comme de la peste de dîner chez nous, je vous prie de croire.\\n\\n--Alors, mon cher, prenez un second verre de xérès et un autre biscuit.\\n\\n--Volontiers, votre vin d'Espagne est excellent; vous voyez bien que\\nnous avons eu tout à fait raison de pacifier ce pays-là.\\n\\n--Oui, mais don Carlos?\\n\\n--Eh bien, don Carlos boira du vin de Bordeaux et dans dix ans nous\\nmarierons son fils à la petite reine.\\n\\n--Ce qui vous vaudra la Toison d'or, si vous êtes encore au ministère.\\n\\n--Je crois, Albert, que vous avez adopté pour système ce matin de me\\nnourrir de fumée.\\n\\n--Eh! c'est encore ce qui amuse le mieux l'estomac, convenez-en; mais,\\ntenez, justement j'entends la voix de Beauchamp dans l'antichambre, vous\\nvous disputerez, cela vous fera prendre patience.\\n\\n--À propos de quoi?\\n\\n--À propos de journaux.\\n\\n--Oh! cher ami, dit Lucien avec un souverain mépris, est-ce que je lis\\nles journaux!\\n\\n--Raison de plus, alors vous vous disputerez bien davantage.\\n\\n--M. Beauchamp! annonça le valet de chambre.\\n\\n--Entrez, entrez! plume terrible! dit Albert en se levant et en allant\\nau-devant du jeune homme. Tenez, voici Debray qui vous déteste sans vous\\nlire, à ce qu'il dit du moins.\\n\\n--Il a bien raison, dit Beauchamp, c'est comme moi, je le critique sans\\nsavoir ce qu'il fait. Bonjour, commandeur.\\n\\n--Ah! vous savez déjà cela, répondit le secrétaire particulier en\\néchangeant avec le journaliste une poignée de main et un sourire.\\n\\n--Pardieu! reprit Beauchamp.\\n\\n--Et qu'en dit-on dans le monde?\\n\\n--Dans quel monde? Nous avons beaucoup de mondes en l'an de grâce 1838.\\n\\n--Eh! dans le monde critico-politique, dont vous êtes un des lions.\\n\\n--Mais on dit que c'est chose fort juste, et que vous semez assez de\\nrouge pour qu'il pousse un peu de bleu.\\n\\n--Allons, allons, pas mal, dit Lucien: pourquoi n'êtes vous pas des\\nnôtres, mon cher Beauchamp? Ayant de l'esprit comme vous en avez, vous\\nferiez fortune en trois ou quatre ans.\\n\\n--Aussi, je n'attends qu'une chose pour suivre votre conseil: c'est un\\nministère qui soit assuré pour six mois. Maintenant, un seul mot, mon\\ncher Albert, car aussi bien faut-il que je laisse respirer le pauvre\\nLucien. Déjeunons-nous ou dînons-nous? J'ai la Chambre, moi. Tout n'est\\npas rose, comme vous le voyez, dans notre métier.\\n\\n--On déjeunera seulement; nous n'attendons plus que deux personnes, et\\nl'on se mettra à table aussitôt qu'elles seront arrivées.\\n\\n--Et quelles sortes de personnes attendez-vous à déjeuner? dit\\nBeauchamp.\\n\\n--Un gentilhomme et un diplomate, reprit Albert.\\n\\n--Alors c'est l'affaire de deux petites heures pour le gentilhomme et de\\ndeux grandes heures pour le diplomate. Je reviendrai au dessert.\\nGardez-moi des fraises, du café et des cigares. Je mangerai une\\ncôtelette à la Chambre.\\n\\n--N'en faites rien, Beauchamp, car le gentilhomme fût-il un Montmorency,\\net le diplomate un Metternich, nous déjeunerons à dix heures et demie\\nprécises; en attendant faites comme Debray, goûtez mon xérès et mes\\nbiscuits.\\n\\n--Allons donc, soit, je reste. Il faut absolument que je me distraie ce\\nmatin.\\n\\n--Bon, vous voilà comme Debray! Il me semble cependant que lorsque le\\nministère est triste l'opposition doit être gaie.\\n\\n--Ah! voyez-vous, cher ami, c'est que vous ne savez point ce qui me\\nmenace. J'entendrai ce matin un discours de M. Danglars à la Chambre des\\ndéputés, et ce soir, chez sa femme, une tragédie d'un pair de France. Le\\ndiable emporte le gouvernement constitutionnel! et puisque nous avions\\nle choix, à ce qu'on dit, comment avons-nous choisi celui-là?\\n\\n--Je comprends; vous avez besoin de faire provision d'hilarité.\\n\\n--Ne dites donc pas de mal des discours de M. Danglars, dit Debray: il\\nvote pour vous, il fait de l'opposition.\\n\\n--Voilà, pardieu, bien le mal! aussi j'attends que vous l'envoyiez\\ndiscourir au Luxembourg pour en rire tout à mon aise.\\n\\n--Mon cher, dit Albert à Beauchamp, on voit bien que les affaires\\nd'Espagne sont arrangées, vous êtes ce matin d'une aigreur révoltante.\\nRappelez-vous donc que la chronique parisienne parle d'un mariage entre\\nmoi et Mlle Eugénie Danglars. Je ne puis donc pas, en conscience, vous\\nlaisser mal parler de l'éloquence d'un homme qui doit me dire un jour:\\n«Monsieur le vicomte, vous savez que je donne deux millions à ma fille.»\\n\\n--Allons donc! dit Beauchamp, ce mariage ne se fera jamais. Le roi a pu\\nle faire baron, il pourra le faire pair, mais il ne le fera point\\ngentilhomme, et le comte de Morcerf est une épée trop aristocratique\\npour consentir, moyennant deux pauvres millions, à une mésalliance. Le\\nvicomte de Morcerf ne doit épouser qu'une marquise.\\n\\n--Deux millions! c'est cependant joli! reprit Morcerf.\\n\\n--C'est le capital social d'un théâtre de boulevard ou d'un chemin de\\nfer du jardin des Plantes à la Râpée.\\n\\n--Laissez-le dire, Morcerf, reprit nonchalamment Debray, et\\nmariez-vous. Vous épousez l'étiquette d'un sac, n'est-ce pas? eh bien,\\nque vous importe! mieux vaut alors sur cette étiquette un blason de\\nmoins et un zéro de plus; vous avez sept merlettes dans vos armes, vous\\nen donnerez trois à votre femme et il vous en restera encore quatre.\\nC'est une de plus qu'a M. de Guise, qui a failli être roi de France, et\\ndont le cousin germain était empereur d'Allemagne.\\n\\n--Ma foi, je crois que vous avez raison, Lucien, répondit distraitement\\nAlbert.\\n\\n--Et certainement! D'ailleurs tout millionnaire est noble comme un\\nbâtard, c'est-à-dire qu'il peut l'être.\\n\\n--Chut! ne dites pas cela, Debray, reprit en riant Beauchamp, car voici\\nChâteau-Renaud qui, pour vous guérir de votre manie de paradoxer, vous\\npassera au travers du corps l'épée de Renaud de Montauban, son ancêtre.\\n\\n--Il dérogerait alors, répondit Lucien, car je suis vilain et très\\nvilain.\\n\\n--Bon! s'écria Beauchamp, voilà le ministère qui chante du Béranger, où\\nallons-nous, mon Dieu?\\n\\n--M. de Château-Renaud! M. Maximilien Morrel! dit le valet de chambre,\\nen annonçant deux nouveaux convives.\\n\\n--Complets alors! dit Beauchamp, et nous allons déjeuner; car, si je ne\\nme trompe, vous n'attendiez plus que deux personnes, Albert?\\n\\n--Morrel! murmura Albert surpris; Morrel! qu'est-ce que cela?»\\n\\nMais avant qu'il eût achevé, M. de Château-Renaud, beau jeune homme de\\ntrente ans, gentilhomme des pieds à la tête, c'est-à-dire avec la figure\\nd'un Guiche et l'esprit d'un Mortemart, avait pris Albert par la main:\\n\\n«Permettez-moi, mon cher, lui dit-il, de vous présenter M. le capitaine\\nde spahis Maximilien Morrel, mon ami, et de plus mon sauveur. Au reste,\\nl'homme se présente assez bien par lui-même. Saluez mon héros, vicomte.»\\n\\nEt il se rangea pour démasquer ce grand et noble jeune homme au front\\nlarge, à l'oeil perçant, aux moustaches noires, que nos lecteurs se\\nrappellent avoir vu à Marseille, dans une circonstance assez dramatique\\npour qu'ils ne l'aient point encore oublié. Un riche uniforme,\\ndemi-français, demi-oriental, admirablement porté faisait valoir sa\\nlarge poitrine décorée de la croix de la Légion d'honneur, et ressortir\\nla cambrure hardie de sa taille. Le jeune officier s'inclina avec une\\npolitesse d'élégance; Morrel était gracieux dans chacun de ses\\nmouvements, parce qu'il était fort.\\n\\n«Monsieur, dit Albert avec une affectueuse courtoisie, M. le baron de\\nChâteau-Renaud savait d'avance tout le plaisir qu'il me procurait en me\\nfaisant faire votre connaissance; vous êtes de ses amis, monsieur, soyez\\ndes nôtres.\\n\\n--Très bien, dit Château-Renaud, et souhaitez, mon cher vicomte, que le\\ncas échéant il fasse pour vous ce qu'il a fait pour moi.\\n\\n--Et qu'a-t-il donc fait? demanda Albert.\\n\\n--Oh! dit Morrel, cela ne vaut pas la peine d'en parler, et monsieur\\nexagère.\\n\\n--Comment! dit Château-Renaud, cela ne vaut pas la peine d'en parler! La\\nvie ne vaut pas la peine qu'on en parle!... En vérité, c'est par trop\\nphilosophique ce que vous dites là, mon cher monsieur Morrel.... Bon\\npour vous qui exposez votre vie tous les jours, mais pour moi qui\\nl'expose une fois par hasard....\\n\\n--Ce que je vois de plus clair dans tout cela, baron, c'est que M. le\\ncapitaine Morrel vous a sauvé la vie.\\n\\n--Oh! mon Dieu, oui, tout bonnement, reprit Château-Renaud.\\n\\n--Et à quelle occasion? demanda Beauchamp.\\n\\n--Beauchamp, mon ami, vous saurez que je meurs de faim, dit Debray, ne\\ndonnez donc pas dans les histoires.\\n\\n--Eh bien, mais, dit Beauchamp, je n'empêche pas qu'on se mette à table,\\nmoi.... Château-Renaud nous racontera cela à table.\\n\\n--Messieurs, dit Morcerf, il n'est encore que dix heures un quart,\\nremarquez bien cela, et nous attendons un dernier convive.\\n\\n--Ah! c'est vrai, un diplomate, reprit Debray.\\n\\n--Un diplomate, ou autre chose, je n'en sais rien, ce que je sais, c'est\\nque pour mon compte je l'ai chargé d'une ambassade qu'il a si bien\\nterminée à ma satisfaction, qui si j'avais été roi, je l'eusse fait à\\nl'instant même chevalier de tous mes ordres, eussé-je eu à la fois la\\ndisposition de la Toison d'or et de la Jarretière.\\n\\n--Alors, puisqu'on ne se met point encore à table, dit Debray,\\nversez-vous un verre de xérès comme nous avons fait, et racontez-nous\\ncela, baron.\\n\\n--Vous savez tous que l'idée m'était venue d'aller en Afrique.\\n\\n--C'est un chemin que vos ancêtres vous ont tracé, mon cher\\nChâteau-Renaud, répondit galamment Morcerf.\\n\\n--Oui, mais je doute que cela fût, comme eux, pour délivrer le tombeau\\ndu Christ.\\n\\n--Et vous avez raison, Beauchamp, dit le jeune aristocrate; c'était tout\\nbonnement pour faire le coup de pistolet en amateur. Le duel me répugne,\\ncomme vous savez, depuis que deux témoins, que j'avais choisis pour\\naccommoder une affaire, m'ont forcé de casser le bras à un de mes\\nmeilleurs amis... eh pardieu! à ce pauvre Franz d'Épinay, que vous\\nconnaissez tous.\\n\\n--Ah oui! c'est vrai, dit Debray, vous vous êtes battu dans le temps...\\nÀ quel propos?\\n\\n--Le diable m'emporte si je m'en souviens! dit Château-Renaud; mais ce\\nque je me rappelle parfaitement, c'est qu'ayant honte de laisser dormir\\nun talent comme le mien, j'ai voulu essayer sur les Arabes des pistolets\\nneufs dont on venait de me faire cadeau. En conséquence je m'embarquai\\npour Oran; d'Oran je gagnai Constantine, et j'arrivai juste pour voir\\nlever le siège. Je me mis en retraite comme les autres. Pendant\\nquarante-huit heures je supportai assez bien la pluie le jour, la neige\\nla nuit; enfin, dans la troisième matinée, mon cheval mourut de froid.\\nPauvre bête! accoutumée aux couvertures et au poêle de l'écurie... un\\ncheval arabe qui seulement s'est trouvé un peu dépaysé en rencontrant\\ndix degrés de froid en Arabie.\\n\\n--C'est pour cela que vous voulez m'acheter mon cheval anglais, dit\\nDebray; vous supposez qu'il supportera mieux le froid que votre arabe.\\n\\n--Vous vous trompez, car j'ai fait voeu de ne plus retourner en Afrique.\\n\\n--Vous avez donc eu bien peur? demanda Beauchamp.\\n\\n--Ma foi, oui, je l'avoue, répondit Château-Renaud; et il y avait de\\nquoi! Mon cheval était donc mort; je faisais ma retraite à pied; six\\nArabes vinrent au galop pour me couper la tête, j'en abattis deux de\\nmes deux coups de fusil, deux de mes deux coups de pistolet, mouches\\npleines; mais il en restait deux, et j'étais désarmé. L'un me prit par\\nles cheveux, c'est pour cela que je les porte courts maintenant, on ne\\nsait pas ce qui peut arriver, l'autre m'enveloppa le cou de son yatagan,\\net je sentais déjà le froid aigu du fer, quand monsieur, que vous voyez,\\nchargea à son tour sur eux, tua celui qui me tenait par les cheveux d'un\\ncoup de pistolet, et fendit la tête de celui qui s'apprêtait à me couper\\nla gorge d'un coup de sabre. Monsieur s'était donné pour tâche de sauver\\nun homme ce jour-là, le hasard a voulu que ce fût moi; quand je serai\\nriche, je ferai faire par Klagmann ou par Marochetti une statue du\\nHasard.\\n\\n--Oui, dit en souriant Morrel, c'était le 5 septembre, c'est-à-dire\\nl'anniversaire d'un jour où mon père fut miraculeusement sauvé; aussi,\\nautant qu'il est en mon pouvoir, je célèbre tous les ans ce jour-là par\\nquelque action....\\n\\n--Héroïque, n'est-ce pas? interrompit Château-Renaud; bref, je fus\\nl'élu, mais ce n'est pas tout. Après m'avoir sauvé du fer, il me sauva\\ndu froid, en me donnant, non pas la moitié de son manteau, comme faisait\\nsaint Martin, mais en me le donnant tout entier; puis de la faim, en\\npartageant avec moi, devinez quoi?\\n\\n--Un pâté de chez Félix? demanda Beauchamp.\\n\\n--Non pas, son cheval, dont nous mangeâmes chacun un morceau de grand\\nappétit: c'était dur.\\n\\n--Le cheval? demanda en riant Morcerf.\\n\\n--Non, le sacrifice, répondit Château-Renaud. Demandez à Debray s'il\\nsacrifierait son anglais pour un étranger?\\n\\n--Pour un étranger, non, dit Debray mais pour un ami, peut-être.\\n\\n--Je devinai que vous deviendriez le mien, monsieur le baron, dit\\nMorrel; d'ailleurs, j'ai déjà eu l'honneur de vous le dire, héroïsme ou\\nnon, sacrifice ou non, ce jour-là je devais une offrande à la mauvaise\\nfortune en récompense de la faveur que nous avait faite autrefois la\\nbonne.\\n\\n--Cette histoire à laquelle M. Morrel fait allusion, continua\\nChâteau-Renaud, est toute une admirable histoire qu'il vous racontera\\nun jour, quand vous aurez fait avec lui plus ample connaissance; pour\\naujourd'hui, garnissons l'estomac et non la mémoire. À quelle heure\\ndéjeunez-vous, Albert.\\n\\n--À dix heures et demie.\\n\\n--Précises? demanda Debray en tirant sa montre.\\n\\n--Oh! vous m'accorderez bien les cinq minutes de grâce, dit Morcerf,\\ncar, moi aussi, j'attends un sauveur.\\n\\n--À qui?\\n\\n--À moi, parbleu! répondit Morcerf. Croyez-vous donc qu'on ne puisse\\npas me sauver comme un autre et qu'il n'y a que les Arabes qui coupent\\nla tête! Notre déjeuner est un déjeuner philanthropique, et nous aurons\\nà notre table, je l'espère du moins, deux bienfaiteurs de l'humanité.\\n\\n--Comment ferons-nous? dit Debray, nous n'avons qu'un prix Montyon?\\n\\n--Eh bien, mais on le donnera à quelqu'un qui n'aura rien fait pour\\nl'avoir, dit Beauchamp. C'est de cette façon-là que d'ordinaire\\nl'Académie se tire d'embarras.\\n\\n--Et d'où vient-il? demanda Debray; excusez l'insistance; vous avez\\ndéjà, je le sais bien, répondu à cette question, mais assez vaguement\\npour que je me permette de la poser une seconde fois.\\n\\n--En vérité, dit Albert, je n'en sais rien. Quand je l'ai invité, il y a\\ntrois mois de cela, il était à Rome; mais depuis ce temps-là, qui peut\\ndire le chemin qu'il a fait!\\n\\n--Et le croyez-vous capable d'être exact? demanda Debray.\\n\\n--Je le crois capable de tout, répondit Morcerf.\\n\\n--Faites attention qu'avec les cinq minutes de grâce, nous n'avons plus\\nque dix minutes.\\n\\n--Eh bien, j'en profiterai pour vous dire un mot de mon convive.\\n\\n--Pardon, dit Beauchamp, y a-t-il matière à un feuilleton dans ce que\\nvous allez nous raconter?\\n\\n--Oui, certes, dit Morcerf, et des plus curieux, même.\\n\\n--Dites alors, car je vois bien que je manquerai la Chambre; il faut\\nbien que je me rattrape.\\n\\n--J'étais à Rome au carnaval dernier.\\n\\n--Nous savons cela, dit Beauchamp.\\n\\n--Oui, mais ce que vous ne savez pas, c'est que j'avais été enlevé par\\ndes brigands.\\n\\n--Il n'y a pas de brigands, dit Debray.\\n\\n--Si fait, il y en a, et de hideux même, c'est-à-dire d'admirables, car\\nje les ai trouvés beaux à faire peur.\\n\\n--Voyons, mon cher Albert, dit Debray, avouez que votre cuisinier est en\\nretard, que les huîtres ne sont pas arrivées de Marennes ou d'Ostende,\\net qu'à l'exemple de Mme de Maintenon, vous voulez remplacer le plat par\\nun comte. Dites-le, mon cher, nous sommes d'assez bonne compagnie pour\\nvous le pardonner et pour écouter votre histoire, toute fabuleuse\\nqu'elle promet d'être.\\n\\n--Et, moi, je vous dis, toute fabuleuse qu'elle est, que je vous la\\ndonne pour vraie d'un bout à l'autre. Les brigands m'avaient donc enlevé\\net m'avaient conduit dans un endroit fort triste qu'on appelle les\\ncatacombes de Saint-Sébastien.\\n\\n--Je connais cela, dit Château-Renaud, j'ai manqué d'y attraper la\\nfièvre.\\n\\n--Et, moi, j'ai fait mieux que cela, dit Morcerf, je l'ai eue\\nréellement. On m'avait annoncé que j'étais prisonnier sauf rançon, une\\nmisère, quatre mille écus romains, vingt-six mille livres tournois.\\nMalheureusement je n'en avais plus que quinze cents; j'étais au bout de\\nmon voyage et mon crédit était épuisé. J'écrivis à Franz. Et, pardieu!\\ntenez, Franz en était, et vous pouvez lui demander si je mens d'une\\nvirgule; j'écrivis à Franz que s'il n'arrivait pas à six heures du matin\\navec les quatre mille écus, à six heures dix minutes j'aurais rejoint\\nles bienheureux saints et les glorieux martyrs dans la compagnie\\ndesquels j'avais eu l'honneur de me trouver. Et M. Luigi Vampa, c'est le\\nnom de mon chef de brigands, m'aurait, je vous prie de le croire, tenu\\nscrupuleusement parole.\\n\\n--Mais Franz arriva avec les quatre mille écus? dit Château-Renaud. Que\\ndiable! on n'est pas embarrassé pour quatre mille écus quand on\\ns'appelle Franz d'Épinay ou Albert de Morcerf.\\n\\n--Non, il arriva purement et simplement accompagné du convive que je\\nvous annonce et que j'espère vous présenter.\\n\\n--Ah çà! mais c'est donc un Hercule tuant Cacus, que ce monsieur, un\\nPersée délivrant Andromède?\\n\\n--Non, c'est un homme de ma taille à peu près.\\n\\n--Armé jusqu'aux dents?\\n\\n--Il n'avait pas même une aiguille à tricoter.\\n\\n--Mais il traita de votre rançon?\\n\\n--Il dit deux mots à l'oreille du chef, et je fus libre.\\n\\n--On lui fit même des excuses de vous avoir arrêté, dit Beauchamp.\\n\\n--Justement, dit Morcerf.\\n\\n--Ah çà! mais c'était donc l'Arioste que cet homme?\\n\\n--Non, c'était tout simplement le comte de Monte-Cristo.\\n\\n--On ne s'appelle pas le comte de Monte-Cristo, dit Debray.\\n\\n--Je ne crois pas, ajouta Château-Renaud avec le sang-froid d'un homme\\nqui connaît sur le bout du doigt son nobilaire européen; qui est-ce qui\\nconnaît quelque part un comte de Monte-Cristo?\\n\\n--Il vient peut-être de Terre Sainte, dit Beauchamp; un de ses aïeux\\naura possédé le Calvaire, comme les Mortemart la mer Morte.\\n\\n--Pardon, dit Maximilien, mais je crois que je vais vous tirer\\nd'embarras, messieurs; Monte-Cristo est une petite île dont j'ai\\nsouvent entendu parler aux marins qu'employait mon père: un grain de\\nsable au milieu de la Méditerranée, un atome dans l'infini.\\n\\n--C'est parfaitement cela, monsieur! dit Albert. Eh bien, de ce grain de\\nsable, de cet atome, est seigneur et roi celui dont je vous parle; il\\naura acheté ce brevet de comte quelque part en Toscane.\\n\\n--Il est donc riche, votre comte?\\n\\n--Ma foi, je le crois.\\n\\n--Mais cela doit se voir, ce me semble?\\n\\n--Voilà ce qui vous trompe, Debray.\\n\\n--Je ne vous comprends plus.\\n\\n--Avez-vous lu les _Mille et une Nuits_?\\n\\n--Parbleu! belle question!\\n\\n--Eh bien, savez-vous donc si les gens qu'on y voit sont riches ou\\npauvres? si leurs grains de blé ne sont pas des rubis ou des diamants?\\nIls ont l'air de misérables pêcheurs, n'est-ce pas? vous les traitez\\ncomme tels, et tout à coup ils vous ouvrent quelque caverne mystérieuse,\\noù vous trouvez un trésor à acheter l'Inde.\\n\\n--Après?\\n\\n--Après, mon comte de Monte-Cristo est un de ces pêcheurs-là. Il a même\\nun nom tiré de la chose, il s'appelle Simbad le marin et possède une\\ncaverne pleine d'or.\\n\\n--Et vous avez vu cette caverne, Morcerf? demanda Beauchamp.\\n\\n--Non, pas moi, Franz. Mais, chut! il ne faut pas dire un mot de cela\\ndevant lui. Franz y est descendu les yeux bandés, et il a été servi par\\ndes muets et par des femmes près desquelles, à ce qu'il paraît,\\nCléopâtre n'est qu'une lorette. Seulement des femmes il n'en est pas\\nbien sûr, vu qu'elles ne sont entrées qu'après qu'il eut mangé du\\nhaschich; de sorte qu'il se pourrait bien que ce qu'il a pris pour des\\nfemmes fût tout bonnement un quadrille de statues.»\\n\\nLes jeunes gens regardèrent Morcerf d'un oeil qui voulait dire:\\n\\n«Ah çà, mon cher, devenez-vous insensé, ou vous moquez-vous de nous?\\n\\n--En effet, dit Morrel pensif, j'ai entendu raconter encore par un vieux\\nmarin nommé Penelon quelque chose de pareil à ce que dit là M. de\\nMorcerf.\\n\\n--Ah! fit Albert, c'est bien heureux que M. Morrel me vienne en aide.\\nCela vous contrarie, n'est-ce pas, qu'il jette ainsi un peloton de fil\\ndans mon labyrinthe?\\n\\n--Pardon, cher ami, dit Debray, c'est que vous nous racontez des choses\\nsi invraisemblables....\\n\\n--Ah parbleu! parce que vos ambassadeurs, vos consuls ne vous en parlent\\npas! Ils n'ont pas le temps, il faut bien qu'ils molestent leurs\\ncompatriotes qui voyagent.\\n\\n--Ah! bon, voilà que vous vous fâchez, et que vous tombez sur nos\\npauvres agents. Eh! mon Dieu! avec quoi voulez-vous qu'ils vous\\nprotègent? la Chambre leur rogne tous les jours leurs appointements;\\nc'est au point qu'on n'en trouve plus. Voulez-vous être ambassadeur,\\nAlbert? je vous fais nommer à Constantinople.\\n\\n--Non pas! pour que le sultan, à la première démonstration que je ferai\\nen faveur de Méhémet-Ali, m'envoie le cordon et que mes secrétaires\\nm'étranglent.\\n\\n--Vous voyez bien, dit Debray.\\n\\n--Oui, mais tout cela n'empêche pas mon comte de Monte-Cristo d'exister!\\n\\n--Pardieu! tout le monde existe, le beau miracle!\\n\\n--Tout le monde existe, sans doute, mais pas dans des conditions\\npareilles. Tout le monde n'a pas des esclaves noirs, des galeries\\nprincières, des armes comme à la casauba, des chevaux de six mille\\nfrancs pièce, des maîtresses grecques!\\n\\n--L'avez-vous vue, la maîtresse grecque?\\n\\n--Oui, je l'ai vue et entendue. Vue au théâtre Valle, entendue un jour\\nque j'ai déjeuné chez le comte.\\n\\n--Il mange donc, votre homme extraordinaire?\\n\\n--Ma foi, s'il mange, c'est si peu, que ce n'est point la peine d'en\\nparler.\\n\\n--Vous verrez que c'est un vampire.\\n\\n--Riez si vous voulez. C'était l'opinion de la comtesse G..., qui,\\ncomme vous le savez, a connu Lord Ruthwen.\\n\\n--Ah! joli! dit Beauchamp, voilà pour un homme non journaliste le\\npendant du fameux serpent de mer du _constitutionnel_; un vampire, c'est\\nparfait!\\n\\n--Oeil fauve dont la prunelle diminue et se dilate à volonté, dit\\nDebray; angle facial développé, front magnifique, teint livide, barbe\\nnoire, dents blanches et aiguës, politesse toute pareille.\\n\\n--Eh bien, c'est justement cela, Lucien, dit Morcerf, et le signalement\\nest tracé trait pour trait. Oui, politesse aiguë et incisive. Cet homme\\nm'a souvent donné le frisson; un jour entre autres, que nous regardions\\nensemble une exécution, j'ai cru que j'allais me trouver mal, bien plus\\nde le voir et de l'entendre causer froidement sur tous les supplices de\\nla terre, que de voir le bourreau remplir son office et que d'entendre\\nles cris du patient.\\n\\n--Ne vous a-t-il pas conduit un peu dans les ruines du Colisée pour vous\\nsucer le sang, Morcerf? demanda Beauchamp.\\n\\n--Ou, après vous avoir délivré, ne vous a-t-il pas fait signer quelque\\nparchemin couleur de feu, par lequel vous lui cédiez votre âme, comme\\nÉsaü son droit d'aînesse?\\n\\n--Raillez! raillez tant que vous voudrez, messieurs! dit Morcerf un peu\\npiqué. Quand je vous regarde, vous autres beaux Parisiens, habitués du\\nboulevard de Gand, promeneurs du bois de Boulogne, et que je me\\nrappelle cet homme, eh bien, il me semble que nous ne sommes pas de la\\nmême espèce.\\n\\n--Je m'en flatte! dit Beauchamp.\\n\\n--Toujours est-il, ajouta Château-Renaud, que votre comte de\\nMonte-Cristo est un galant homme dans ses moments perdus, sauf toutefois\\nses petits arrangements avec les bandits italiens.\\n\\n--Eh! il n'y a pas de bandits italiens! dit Debray.\\n\\n--Pas de vampires! ajouta Beauchamp.\\n\\n--Pas de comte de Monte-Cristo, ajouta Debray. Tenez, cher Albert, voilà\\ndix heures et demie qui sonnent.\\n\\n--Avouez que vous avez eu le cauchemar, et allons déjeuner», dit\\nBeauchamp.\\n\\nMais la vibration de la pendule ne s'était pas encore éteinte, lorsque\\nla porte s'ouvrit, et que Germain annonça:\\n\\n«Son Excellence le comte de Monte-Cristo!»\\n\\nTous les auditeurs firent malgré eux un bond qui dénotait la\\npréoccupation que le récit de Morcerf avait infiltrée dans leurs âmes.\\nAlbert lui-même ne put se défendre d'une émotion soudaine.\\n\\nOn n'avait entendu ni voiture dans la rue, ni pas dans l'antichambre; la\\nporte elle-même s'était ouverte sans bruit.\\n\\nLe comte parut sur le seuil, vêtu avec la plus grande simplicité, mais\\nle _lion_ le plus exigeant n'eût rien trouvé à reprendre à sa toilette.\\nTout était d'un goût exquis, tout sortait des mains des plus élégants\\nfournisseurs, habits, chapeau et linge.\\n\\nIl paraissait âgé de trente-cinq ans à peine, et, ce qui frappa tout le\\nmonde, ce fut son extrême ressemblance avec le portrait qu'avait tracé\\nde lui Debray.\\n\\nLe comte s'avança en souriant au milieu du salon, et vint droit à\\nAlbert, qui, marchant au-devant de lui, lui offrit la main avec\\nempressement.\\n\\n«L'exactitude, dit Monte-Cristo, est la politesse des rois, à ce qu'a\\nprétendu, je crois, un de nos souverains. Mais quelle que soit leur\\nbonne volonté, elle n'est pas toujours celle des voyageurs. Cependant\\nj'espère, mon cher vicomte, que vous excuserez, en faveur de ma bonne\\nvolonté, les deux ou trois secondes de retard que je crois avoir mises à\\nparaître au rendez-vous. Cinq cents lieues ne se font pas sans quelque\\ncontrariété, surtout en France, où il est défendu, à ce qu'il paraît, de\\nbattre les postillons.\\n\\n--Monsieur le comte, répondit Albert, j'étais en train d'annoncer votre\\nvisite à quelques-uns de mes amis que j'ai réunis à l'occasion de la\\npromesse que vous avez bien voulu me faire, et que j'ai l'honneur de\\nvous présenter. Ce sont M. le comte de Château-Renaud, dont la noblesse\\nremonte aux Douze pairs, et dont les ancêtres ont eu leur place à la\\nTable Ronde; M. Lucien Debray, secrétaire particulier du ministre de\\nl'intérieur; M. Beauchamp, terrible journaliste, l'effroi du\\ngouvernement français, mais dont peut-être, malgré sa célébrité\\nnationale, vous n'avez jamais entendu parler en Italie, attendu que son\\njournal n'y entre pas; enfin M. Maximilien Morrel, capitaine de spahis.»\\n\\nÀ ce nom, le comte, qui avait jusque-là salué courtoisement, mais avec\\nune froideur et une impassibilité tout anglaises, fit malgré lui un pas\\nen avant, et un léger ton de vermillon passa comme l'éclair sur ses\\njoues pâles.\\n\\n«Monsieur porte l'uniforme des nouveaux vainqueurs français, dit-il,\\nc'est un bel uniforme.»\\n\\nOn n'eût pas pu dire quel était le sentiment qui donnait à la voix du\\ncomte une si profonde vibration et qui faisait briller, comme malgré\\nlui, son oeil si beau, si calme et si limpide, quand il n'avait point un\\nmotif quelconque pour le voiler.\\n\\n«Vous n'aviez jamais vu nos Africains, monsieur? dit Albert.\\n\\n--Jamais, répliqua le comte, redevenu parfaitement libre de lui.\\n\\n--Eh bien, monsieur, sous cet uniforme bat un des coeurs les plus braves\\net les plus nobles de l'armée.\\n\\n--Oh! monsieur le comte, interrompit Morrel.\\n\\n--Laissez-moi dire, capitaine.... Et nous venons, continua Albert,\\nd'apprendre de monsieur un fait si héroïque, que, quoique je l'aie vu\\naujourd'hui pour la première fois, je réclame de lui la faveur de vous\\nle présenter comme mon ami.»\\n\\nEt l'on put encore, à ces paroles, remarquer chez Monte-Cristo ce regard\\nétrange de fixité, cette rougeur furtive et ce léger tremblement de la\\npaupière qui, chez lui, décelaient l'émotion.\\n\\n«Ah! Monsieur est un noble coeur, dit le comte, tant mieux!»\\n\\nCette espèce d'exclamation, qui répondait à la propre pensée du comte\\nplutôt qu'à ce que venait de dire Albert, surprit tout le monde et\\nsurtout Morrel, qui regarda Monte-Cristo avec étonnement. Mais en même\\ntemps l'intonation était si douce et pour ainsi dire si suave que,\\nquelque étrange que fût cette exclamation, il n'y avait pas moyen de\\ns'en fâcher.\\n\\n«Pourquoi en douterait-il? dit Beauchamp à Château-Renaud.\\n\\n--En vérité, répondit celui-ci, qui, avec son habitude du monde et la\\nnetteté de son oeil aristocratique, avait pénétré de Monte-Cristo tout\\nce qui était pénétrable en lui, en vérité Albert ne nous a point\\ntrompés, et c'est un singulier personnage que le comte; qu'en\\ndites-vous, Morrel?\\n\\n--Ma foi, dit celui-ci, il a l'oeil franc et la voix sympathique, de\\nsorte qu'il me plaît, malgré la réflexion bizarre qu'il vient de faire à\\nmon endroit.\\n\\n--Messieurs, dit Albert, Germain m'annonce que vous êtes servis. Mon\\ncher comte, permettez-moi de vous montrer le chemin.»\\n\\nOn passa silencieusement dans la salle à manger. Chacun prit sa place.\\n\\n«Messieurs, dit le comte en s'asseyant, permettez-moi un aveu qui sera\\nmon excuse pour toutes les inconvenances que je pourrai faire: je suis\\nétranger, mais étranger à tel point que c'est la première fois que je\\nviens à Paris. La vie française m'est donc parfaitement inconnue, et je\\nn'ai guère jusqu'à présent pratiqué que la vie orientale, la plus\\nantipathique aux bonnes traditions parisiennes. Je vous prie donc de\\nm'excuser si vous trouvez en moi quelque chose de trop turc, de trop\\nnapolitain ou de trop arabe. Cela dit, messieurs, déjeunons.\\n\\n--Comme il dit tout cela! murmura Beauchamp; c'est décidément un grand\\nseigneur.\\n\\n--Un grand seigneur, ajouta Debray.\\n\\n--Un grand seigneur de tous les pays, monsieur Debray», dit\\nChâteau-Renaud.\",\n",
       " 'XL': \"Le comte, on se le rappelle, était un sobre convive. Albert en fit la\\nremarque en témoignant la crainte que, dès son commencement, la vie\\nparisienne ne déplût au voyageur par son côté le plus matériel, mais en\\nmême temps le plus nécessaire.\\n\\n«Mon cher comte, dit-il, vous me voyez atteint d'une crainte, c'est que\\nla cuisine de la rue du Helder ne vous plaise pas autant que celle de la\\nplace d'Espagne. J'aurais dû vous demander votre goût et vous faire\\npréparer quelques plats à votre fantaisie.\\n\\n--Si vous me connaissiez davantage, monsieur, répondit en souriant le\\ncomte, vous ne vous préoccuperiez pas d'un soin presque humiliant pour\\nun voyageur comme moi, qui a successivement vécu avec du macaroni à\\nNaples, de la polenta à Milan, de l'olla podrida à Valence, du pilau à\\nConstantinople, du karrick dans l'Inde, et des nids d'hirondelle dans la\\nChine. Il n'y a pas de cuisine pour un cosmopolite comme moi. Je mange\\nde tout et partout, seulement je mange peu; et aujourd'hui que vous me\\nreprochez ma sobriété, je suis dans mon jour d'appétit, car depuis hier\\nmatin je n'ai point mangé.\\n\\n--Comment, depuis hier matin! s'écrièrent les convives; vous n'avez\\npoint mangé depuis vingt-quatre heures?\\n\\n--Non, répondit Monte-Cristo; j'avais été obligé de m'écarter de ma\\nroute et de prendre des renseignements aux environs de Nîmes, de sorte\\nque j'étais un peu en retard, et je n'ai pas voulu m'arrêter.\\n\\n--Et vous avez mangé dans votre voiture? demanda Morcerf.\\n\\n--Non, j'ai dormi comme cela m'arrive quand je m'ennuie sans avoir le\\ncourage de me distraire, ou quand j'ai faim sans avoir envie de manger.\\n\\n--Mais vous commandez donc au sommeil, monsieur? demanda Morrel.\\n\\n--À peu près.\\n\\n--Vous avez une recette pour cela?\\n\\n--Infaillible.\\n\\n--Voilà qui serait excellent pour nous autres Africains, qui n'avons pas\\ntoujours de quoi manger, et qui avons rarement de quoi boire, dit\\nMorrel.\\n\\n--Oui, dit Monte-Cristo; malheureusement ma recette, excellente pour un\\nhomme comme moi, qui mène une vie tout exceptionnelle, serait fort\\ndangereuse appliquée à une armée, qui ne se réveillerait plus quand on\\naurait besoin d'elle.\\n\\n--Et peut-on savoir quelle est cette recette? demanda Debray.\\n\\n--Oh! mon Dieu, oui, dit Monte-Cristo, je n'en fais pas de secret:\\nc'est un mélange d'excellent opium que j'ai été chercher moi-même à\\nCanton pour être certain de l'avoir pur, et du meilleur haschich qui se\\nrécolte en Orient, c'est-à-dire entre le Tigre et l'Euphrate; on réunit\\nces deux ingrédients en portions égales, et on fait des espèces de\\npilules qui s'avalent au moment où l'on en a besoin. Dix minutes après\\nl'effet est produit. Demandez à M. le baron Franz d'Épinay, je crois\\nqu'il en a goûté un jour.\\n\\n--Oui, répondit Morcerf, il m'en a dit quelques mots et il en a gardé\\nmême un fort agréable souvenir.\\n\\n--Mais dit Beauchamp, qui en sa qualité de journaliste était fort\\nincrédule, vous portez donc toujours cette drogue sur vous?\\n\\n--Toujours, répondit Monte-Cristo.\\n\\n--Serait-il indiscret de vous demander à voir ces précieuses pilules?\\ncontinua Beauchamp, espérant prendre l'étranger en défaut.\\n\\n--Non, monsieur», répondit le comte.\\n\\nEt il tira de sa poche une merveilleuse bonbonnière creusée dans une\\nseule émeraude et fermée par un écrou d'or qui, en se dévissant, donnait\\npassage à une petite boule de couleur verdâtre et de la grosseur d'un\\npois. Cette boule avait une odeur âcre et pénétrante; il y en avait\\nquatre ou cinq pareilles dans l'émeraude, et elle pouvait en contenir\\nune douzaine.\\n\\nLa bonbonnière fit le tour de la table, mais c'était bien plus pour\\nexaminer cette admirable émeraude que pour voir ou pour flairer les\\npilules, que les convives se la faisaient passer.\\n\\n«Et c'est votre cuisinier qui vous prépare ce régal? demanda Beauchamp.\\n\\n--Non pas, monsieur, dit Monte-Cristo, je ne livre pas comme cela mes\\njouissances réelles à la merci de mains indignes. Je suis assez bon\\nchimiste, et je prépare mes pilules moi-même.\\n\\n--Voilà une admirable émeraude et la plus grosse que j'aie jamais vue,\\nquoique ma mère ait quelques bijoux de famille assez remarquables, dit\\nChâteau-Renaud.\\n\\n--J'en avais trois pareilles, reprit Monte-Cristo: j'ai donné l'une au\\nGrand Seigneur, qui l'a fait monter sur son sabre; l'autre à notre\\nsaint-père le pape, qui l'a fait incruster sur sa tiare en face d'une\\némeraude à peu près pareille, mais moins belle cependant, qui avait été\\ndonnée à son prédécesseur, Pie VII, par l'empereur Napoléon; j'ai gardé\\nla troisième pour moi, et je l'ai fait creuser, ce qui lui a ôté la\\nmoitié de sa valeur, mais ce qui l'a rendue plus commode pour l'usage\\nque j'en voulais faire.»\\n\\nChacun regardait Monte-Cristo avec étonnement; il parlait avec tant de\\nsimplicité, qu'il était évident qu'il disait la vérité ou qu'il était\\nfou; cependant l'émeraude qui était restée entre ses mains faisait que\\nl'on penchait naturellement vers la première supposition.\\n\\n«Et que vous ont donné ces deux souverains en échange de ce magnifique\\ncadeau? demanda Debray.\\n\\n--Le Grand Seigneur, la liberté d'une femme, répondit le comte; notre\\nsaint-père le pape, la vie d'un homme. De sorte qu'une fois dans mon\\nexistence j'ai été aussi puissant que si Dieu m'eût fait naître sur les\\nmarches d'un trône.\\n\\n--Et c'est Peppino que vous avez délivré, n'est-ce pas? s'écria Morcerf;\\nc'est à lui que vous avez fait l'application de votre droit de grâce?\\n\\n--Peut-être, dit Monte-Cristo en souriant.\\n\\n--Monsieur le comte, vous ne vous faites pas l'idée du plaisir que\\nj'éprouve à vous entendre parler ainsi! dit Morcerf. Je vous avais\\nannoncé d'avance à mes amis comme un homme fabuleux, comme un enchanteur\\ndes Mille et une Nuits; comme un sorcier du Moyen Âge; mais les\\nParisiens sont gens tellement subtils en paradoxes, qu'ils prennent pour\\ndes caprices de l'imagination les vérités les plus incontestables, quand\\nces vérités ne rentrent pas dans toutes les conditions de leur existence\\nquotidienne. Par exemple, voici Debray qui lit, et Beauchamp qui imprime\\ntous les jours qu'on a arrêté et qu'on a dévalisé sur le boulevard un\\nmembre du Jockey-Club attardé; qu'on a assassiné quatre personnes rue\\nSaint-Denis ou faubourg Saint-Germain; qu'on a arrêté dix, quinze, vingt\\nvoleurs, soit dans un café du boulevard du Temple, soit dans les\\nThermes de Julien, et qui contestent l'existence des bandits des\\nMaremmes, de la campagne de Rome ou des marais Pontins. Dites-leur donc\\nvous-même, je vous en prie, monsieur le comte, que j'ai été pris par ces\\nbandits, et que, sans votre généreuse intercession, j'attendrais, selon\\ntoute probabilité, aujourd'hui, la résurrection éternelle dans les\\ncatacombes de Saint-Sébastien, au lieu de leur donner à dîner dans mon\\nindigne petite maison de la rue du Helder.\\n\\n--Bah! dit Monte-Cristo, vous m'aviez promis de ne jamais me parler de\\ncette misère.\\n\\n--Ce n'est pas moi, monsieur le comte! s'écria Morcerf, c'est quelque\\nautre à qui vous aurez rendu le même service qu'à moi et que vous aurez\\nconfondu avec moi. Parlons-en, au contraire, je vous en prie; car si\\nvous vous décidez à parler de cette circonstance, peut-être non\\nseulement me redirez-vous un peu de ce que je sais, mais encore beaucoup\\nde ce que je ne sais pas.\\n\\n--Mais il me semble, dit en souriant le comte, que vous avez joué dans\\ntoute cette affaire un rôle assez important pour savoir aussi bien que\\nmoi ce qui s'est passé.\\n\\n--Voulez-vous me promettre, si je dis tout ce que je sais, dit Morcerf,\\nde dire à votre tour tout ce que je ne sais pas?\\n\\n--C'est trop juste, répondit Monte-Cristo.\\n\\n--Eh bien, reprit Morcerf, dût mon amour-propre en souffrir, je me suis\\ncru pendant trois jours l'objet des agaceries d'un masque que je prenais\\npour quelque descendante des Tullie ou des Poppée, tandis que j'étais\\ntout purement et simplement l'objet des agaceries d'une contadîne; et\\nremarquez que je dis contadîne pour ne pas dire paysanne. Ce que je\\nsais, c'est que, comme un niais, plus niais encore que celui dont je\\nparlais tout à l'heure, j'ai pris pour cette paysanne un jeune bandit de\\nquinze ou seize ans, au menton imberbe, à la taille fine, qui, au moment\\noù je voulais m'émanciper jusqu'à déposer un baiser sur sa chaste\\népaule, m'a mis le pistolet sous la gorge, et, avec l'aide de sept ou\\nhuit de ses compagnons, m'a conduit ou plutôt traîné au fond des\\ncatacombes de Saint-Sébastien, où j'ai trouvé un chef de bandits fort\\nlettré, ma foi, lequel lisait les _Commentaires de César_, et qui a\\ndaigné interrompre sa lecture pour me dire que si le lendemain, à six\\nheures du matin, je n'avais pas versé quatre mille écus dans sa caisse,\\nle lendemain à six heures et un quart j'aurais parfaitement cessé\\nd'exister. La lettre existe, elle est entre les mains de Franz, signée\\nde moi, avec un post-scriptum de maître Luigi Vampa. Si vous en doutez,\\nj'écris à Franz, qui fera légaliser les signatures. Voilà ce que je\\nsais. Maintenant, ce que je ne sais pas, c'est comment vous êtes\\nparvenu, monsieur le comte, à frapper d'un si grand respect les bandits\\nde Rome, qui respectent si peu de chose. Je vous avoue que, Franz et\\nmoi, nous en fûmes ravis d'admiration.\\n\\n--Rien de plus simple, monsieur, répondit le comte, je connaissais le\\nfameux Vampa depuis plus de dix ans. Tout jeune et quand il était encore\\nberger, un jour que je lui donnai je ne sais plus quelle monnaie d'or\\nparce qu'il m'avait montré mon chemin, il me donna, lui, pour ne rien\\ndevoir à moi, un poignard sculpté par lui et que vous avez dû voir dans\\nma collection d'armes. Plus tard, soit qu'il eût oublié cet échange de\\npetits cadeaux qui eût dû entretenir l'amitié entre nous, soit qu'il ne\\nm'eût pas reconnu, il tenta de m'arrêter; mais ce fut moi tout au\\ncontraire qui le pris avec une douzaine de ses gens. Je pouvais le\\nlivrer à la justice romaine, qui est expéditive et qui se serait encore\\nhâtée en sa faveur, mais je n'en fis rien. Je le renvoyai, lui et les\\nsiens.\\n\\n--À la condition qu'ils ne pécheraient plus, dit le journaliste en\\nriant. Je vois avec plaisir qu'ils ont scrupuleusement tenu leur parole.\\n\\n--Non, monsieur, répondit Monte-Cristo, à la simple condition qu'ils me\\nrespecteraient toujours, moi et les miens. Peut-être ce que je vais vous\\ndire vous paraîtra-t-il étrange, à vous, messieurs les socialistes, les\\nprogressifs, les humanitaires; mais je ne m'occupe jamais de mon\\nprochain, mais je n'essaye jamais de protéger la société qui ne me\\nprotège pas, et, je dirai même plus, qui généralement ne s'occupe de moi\\nque pour me nuire; et, en les supprimant dans mon estime et en gardant\\nla neutralité vis-à-vis d'eux, c'est encore la société et mon prochain\\nqui me doivent du retour.\\n\\n--À la bonne heure! s'écria Château-Renaud, voilà le premier homme\\ncourageux que j'entends prêcher loyalement et brutalement l'égoïsme:\\nc'est très beau, cela! bravo, monsieur le comte!\\n\\n--C'est franc du moins, dit Morrel; mais je suis sûr que monsieur le\\ncomte ne s'est pas repenti d'avoir manqué une fois aux principes qu'il\\nvient cependant de nous exposer d'une façon si absolue.\\n\\n--Comment ai-je manqué à ces principes, monsieur?» demanda Monte-Cristo,\\nqui de temps en temps ne pouvait s'empêcher de regarder Maximilien avec\\ntant d'attention, que deux ou trois fois déjà le hardi jeune homme avait\\nbaissé les yeux devant le regard clair et limpide du comte.\\n\\n«Mais il me semble, reprit Morrel, qu'en délivrant M. de Morcerf que\\nvous ne connaissiez pas, vous serviez votre prochain et la société.\\n\\n--Dont il fait le plus bel ornement, dit gravement Beauchamp en vidant\\nd'un seul trait un verre de vin de Champagne.\\n\\n--Monsieur le comte! s'écria Morcerf, vous voilà pris par le\\nraisonnement, vous, c'est-à-dire un des plus rudes logiciens que je\\nconnaisse; et vous allez voir qu'il va vous être clairement démontré\\ntout à l'heure que, loin d'être un égoïste, vous êtes au contraire un\\nphilanthrope. Ah! monsieur le comte, vous vous dites Oriental, Levantin,\\nMalais, Indien, Chinois, sauvage; vous vous appelez Monte-Cristo de\\nvotre nom de famille, Simbad le marin de votre nom de baptême, et voilà\\nque du jour où vous mettez le pied à Paris vous possédez d'instinct le\\nplus grand mérite ou le plus grand défaut de nos excentriques Parisiens,\\nc'est-à-dire que vous usurpez les vices que vous n'avez pas et que vous\\ncachez les vertus que vous avez!\\n\\n--Mon cher vicomte, dit Monte-Cristo, je ne vois pas dans tout ce que\\nj'ai dit ou fait un seul mot qui me vaille, de votre part et de celle de\\nces messieurs le prétendu éloge que je viens de recevoir. Vous n'étiez\\npas un étranger pour moi, puisque je vous connaissais, puisque je vous\\navais cédé deux chambres, puisque je vous avais donné à déjeuner,\\npuisque je vous avais prêté une de mes voitures, puisque nous avions vu\\npasser les masques ensemble dans la rue du Cours, et puisque nous avions\\nregardé d'une fenêtre de la place del Popolo cette exécution qui vous a\\nsi fort impressionné que vous avez failli vous trouver mal. Or, je le\\ndemande à tous ces messieurs, pouvais-je laisser mon hôte entre les mains\\nde ces affreux bandits, comme vous les appelez? D'ailleurs, vous le\\nsavez, j'avais, en vous sauvant, une arrière-pensée qui était de me\\nservir de vous pour m'introduire dans les salons de Paris quand je\\nviendrais visiter la France. Quelque temps vous avez pu considérer cette\\nrésolution comme un projet vague et fugitif; mais aujourd'hui, vous le\\nvoyez, c'est une bonne et belle réalité, à laquelle il faut vous\\nsoumettre sous peine de manquer à votre parole.\\n\\n--Et je la tiendrai, dit Morcerf; mais je crains bien que vous ne soyez\\nfort désenchanté, mon cher comte, vous, habitué aux sites accidentés,\\naux événements pittoresques, aux fantastiques horizons. Chez nous, pas\\nle moindre épisode du genre de ceux auxquels votre vie aventureuse vous\\na habitué. Notre Chimborazzo, c'est Montmartre; notre Himalaya, c'est le\\nmont Valérien; notre Grand-Désert, c'est la plaine de Grenelle, encore y\\nperce-t-on un puits artésien pour que les caravanes y trouvent de\\nl'eau. Nous avons des voleurs, beaucoup même, quoique nous n'en ayons\\npas autant qu'on le dit, mais ces voleurs redoutent infiniment davantage\\nle plus petit mouchard que le plus grand seigneur; enfin, la France est\\nun pays si prosaïque, et Paris une ville si fort civilisée, que vous ne\\ntrouverez pas, en cherchant dans nos quatre-vingt-cinq départements, je\\ndis quatre-vingt-cinq départements, car, bien entendu, j'excepte la\\nCorse de la France, que vous ne trouverez pas dans nos quatre-vingt-cinq\\ndépartements la moindre montagne sur laquelle il n'y ait un télégraphe,\\net la moindre grotte un peu noire dans laquelle un commissaire de police\\nn'ait fait poser un bec de gaz. Il n'y a donc qu'un seul service que je\\npuisse vous rendre, mon cher comte, et pour celui-là je me mets à votre\\ndisposition: vous présenter partout, ou vous faire présenter par mes\\namis, cela va sans dire. D'ailleurs, vous n'avez besoin de personne\\npour cela; avec votre nom, votre fortune et votre esprit (Monte-Cristo\\ns'inclina avec un sourire légèrement ironique), on se présente partout\\nsoi-même, et l'on est bien reçu partout. Je ne peux donc en réalité vous\\nêtre bon qu'à une chose. Si quelque habitude de la vie parisienne\\nquelque expérience du confortable, quelque connaissance de nos bazars\\npeuvent me recommander à vous, je me mets à votre disposition pour vous\\ntrouver une maison convenable. Je n'ose vous proposer de partager mon\\nlogement comme j'ai partagé le vôtre à Rome, moi qui ne professe pas\\nl'égoïsme, mais qui suis égoïste par excellence; car chez moi, excepté\\nmoi, il ne tiendrait pas une ombre, à moins que cette ombre ne fût celle\\nd'une femme.\\n\\n--Ah! fit le comte, voici une réserve toute conjugale. Vous m'avez en\\neffet, monsieur, dit à Rome quelques mots d'un mariage ébauché; dois-je\\nvous féliciter sur votre prochain bonheur?\\n\\n--La chose est toujours à l'état de projet, monsieur le comte.\\n\\n--Et qui dit projet, reprit Debray, veut dire éventualité.\\n\\n--Non pas! dit Morcerf; mon père y tient, et j'espère bien, avant peu,\\nvous présenter, sinon ma femme, du moins ma future: mademoiselle Eugénie\\nDanglars.\\n\\n--Eugénie Danglars! reprit Monte-Cristo; attendez donc: son père\\nn'est-il pas M. le baron Danglars?\\n\\n--Oui, répondit Morcerf; mais baron de nouvelle création.\\n\\n--Oh! qu'importe? répondit Monte-Cristo, s'il a rendu à l'État des\\nservices qui lui aient mérité cette distinction.\\n\\n--D'énormes, dit Beauchamp. Il a, quoique libéral dans l'âme, complété\\nen 1829 un emprunt de six millions pour le roi Charles X, qui l'a, ma\\nfoi, fait baron et chevalier de la Légion d'honneur, de sorte qu'il\\nporte le ruban, non pas à la poche de son gilet, comme on pourrait le\\ncroire, mais bel et bien à la boutonnière de son habit.\\n\\n--Ah! dit Morcerf en riant, Beauchamp, Beauchamp, gardez cela pour _Le\\nCorsaire et Le Charivari_ mais devant moi épargnez mon futur beau-père.»\\n\\nPuis se retournant vers Monte-Cristo:\\n\\n«Mais vous avez tout à l'heure prononcé son nom comme quelqu'un qui\\nconnaîtrait le baron? dit-il.\\n\\n--Je ne le connais pas, dit négligemment Monte-Cristo; mais je ne\\ntarderai pas probablement à faire sa connaissance, attendu que j'ai un\\ncrédit ouvert sur lui par les maisons Richard et Blount de Londres,\\nArstein et Eskeles de Vienne, et Thomson et French de Rome.»\\n\\nEt en prononçant ces deux derniers noms, Monte-Cristo regarda du coin de\\nl'oeil Maximilien Morrel.\\n\\nSi l'étranger s'était attendu à produire de l'effet sur Maximilien\\nMorrel, il ne s'était pas trompé. Maximilien tressaillit comme s'il eût\\nreçu une commotion électrique.\\n\\n«Thomson et French, dit-il: connaissez-vous cette maison, monsieur?\\n\\n--Ce sont mes banquiers dans la capitale du monde chrétien, répondit\\ntranquillement le comte; puis-je vous être bon à quelque chose auprès\\nd'eux.\\n\\n--Oh! monsieur le comte, vous pourriez nous aider peut-être dans des\\nrecherches jusqu'à présent infructueuses; cette maison a autrefois rendu\\nun service à la nôtre, et a toujours, je ne sais pourquoi, nié nous\\navoir rendu ce service.\\n\\n--À vos ordres, monsieur, répondit Monte-Cristo en s'inclinant.\\n\\n--Mais dit Morcerf, nous nous sommes singulièrement écartés, à propos de\\nM. Danglars, du sujet de notre conversation. Il était question de\\ntrouver une habitation convenable au comte de Monte-Cristo; voyons,\\nmessieurs, cotisons-nous pour avoir une idée. Où logerons-nous cet hôte\\nnouveau du Grand-Paris?\\n\\n--Faubourg Saint-Germain, dit Château-Renaud: monsieur trouvera là un\\ncharmant petit hôtel entre cour, et jardin.\\n\\n--Bah! Château-Renaud, dit Debray, vous ne connaissez que votre triste\\net maussade faubourg Saint-Germain, ne l'écoutez pas, monsieur le\\ncomte, logez-vous Chaussée-d'Antin: c'est le véritable centre de Paris.»\\n\\n--Boulevard de l'Opéra, dit Beauchamp; au premier, une maison à balcon.\\nMonsieur le comte y fera apporter des coussins de drap d'argent, et\\nverra, en fumant sa chibouque, ou en avalant ses pilules, toute la\\ncapitale défiler sous ses yeux.\\n\\n--Vous n'avez donc pas d'idées, vous, Morrel, dit Château-Renaud, que\\nvous ne proposez rien?\\n\\n--Si fait, dit en souriant le jeune homme; au contraire, j'en ai une,\\nmais j'attendais que monsieur se laissât tenter par quelqu'une des\\noffres brillantes qu'on vient de lui faire. Maintenant, comme il n'a pas\\nrépondu, je crois pouvoir lui offrir un appartement dans un petit hôtel\\ntout charmant, tout Pompadour, que ma soeur vient de louer depuis un an\\ndans la rue Meslay.\\n\\n--Vous avez une soeur? demanda Monte-Cristo.\\n\\n--Oui, monsieur, et une excellente soeur.\\n\\n--Mariée?\\n\\n--Depuis bientôt neuf ans.\\n\\n--Heureuse? demanda de nouveau le comte.\\n\\n--Aussi heureuse qu'il est permis à une créature humaine de l'être,\\nrépondit Maximilien: elle a épousé l'homme qu'elle aimait, celui qui\\nnous est resté fidèle dans notre mauvaise fortune: Emmanuel Herbault.»\\n\\nMonte-Cristo sourit imperceptiblement.\\n\\n«J'habite là pendant mon semestre, continua Maximilien, et je serai,\\navec mon beau-frère Emmanuel, à la disposition de monsieur le comte pour\\ntous les renseignements dont il aura besoin.\\n\\n--Un moment! s'écria Albert avant que Monte-Cristo eût eu le temps de\\nrépondre, prenez garde à ce que vous faites, monsieur Morrel, vous allez\\nclaquemurer un voyageur, Simbad le marin, dans la vie de famille; un\\nhomme qui est venu pour voir Paris vous allez en faire un patriarche.\\n\\n--Oh! que non pas, répondit Morrel en souriant, ma soeur a vingt-cinq\\nans, mon beau-frère en a trente: ils sont jeunes, gais et heureux;\\nd'ailleurs monsieur le comte sera chez lui, et il ne rencontrera ses\\nhôtes qu'autant qu'il lui plaira de descendre chez eux.\\n\\n--Merci, monsieur, merci, dit Monte-Cristo, je me contenterai d'être\\nprésenté par vous à votre soeur et à votre beau-frère, si vous voulez\\nbien me faire cet honneur; mais je n'ai accepté l'offre d'aucun de ces\\nmessieurs, attendu que j'ai déjà mon habitation toute prête.\\n\\n--Comment! s'écria Morcerf, vous allez donc descendre à l'hôtel? Ce\\nsera fort maussade pour vous, cela.\\n\\n--Étais-je donc si mal à Rome? demanda Monte-Cristo.\\n\\n--Parbleu! à Rome, dit Morcerf, vous aviez dépensé cinquante mille\\npiastres pour vous faire meubler un appartement; mais je présume que\\nvous n'êtes pas disposé à renouveler tous les jours une pareille\\ndépense.\\n\\n--Ce n'est pas cela qui m'a arrêté, répondit Monte-Cristo; mais j'étais\\nrésolu d'avoir une maison à Paris, une maison à moi, j'entends. J'ai\\nenvoyé d'avance mon valet de chambre et il a dû acheter cette maison et\\nme la faire meubler.\\n\\n--Mais dites-nous donc que vous avez un valet de chambre qui connaît\\nParis! s'écria Beauchamp.\\n\\n--C'est la première fois comme moi qu'il vient en France; il est Noir et\\nne parle pas, dit Monte-Cristo.\\n\\n--Alors, c'est Ali? demanda Albert au milieu de la surprise générale.\\n\\n--Oui, monsieur, c'est Ali lui-même, mon Nubien, mon muet, que vous avez\\nvu à Rome, je crois.\\n\\n--Oui, certainement, répondit Morcerf, je me le rappelle à merveille.\\nMais comment avez-vous chargé un Nubien de vous acheter une maison à\\nParis, et un muet de vous la meubler? Il aura fait toutes choses de\\ntravers le pauvre malheureux.\\n\\n--Détrompez-vous, monsieur, je suis certain, au contraire, qu'il aura\\nchoisi toutes choses selon mon goût; car, vous le savez, mon goût n'est\\npas celui de tout le monde. Il est arrivé il y a huit jours; il aura\\ncouru toute la ville avec cet instinct que pourrait avoir un bon chien\\nchassant tout seul; il connaît mes caprices, mes fantaisies, mes\\nbesoins; il aura tout organisé à ma guise. Il savait que j'arriverais\\naujourd'hui à dix heures; depuis neuf heures il m'attendait à la\\nbarrière de Fontainebleau; il m'a remis ce papier; c'est ma nouvelle\\nadresse: tenez, lisez.»\\n\\nEt Monte-Cristo passa un papier à Albert.\\n\\n«Champs-Élysées, 30, lut Morcerf.\\n\\n--Ah! voilà qui est vraiment original! ne put s'empêcher de dire\\nBeauchamp.\\n\\n--Et très princier, ajouta Château-Renaud.\\n\\n--Comment! vous ne connaissez pas votre maison? demanda Debray.\\n\\n--Non, dit Monte-Cristo, je vous ai déjà dit que je ne voulais pas\\nmanquer l'heure. J'ai fait ma toilette dans ma voiture et je suis\\ndescendu à la porte du vicomte.»\\n\\nLes jeunes gens se regardèrent; ils ne savaient si c'était une comédie\\njouée par Monte-Cristo; mais tout ce qui sortait de la bouche de cet\\nhomme avait, malgré son caractère original, un tel cachet de simplicité,\\nque l'on ne pouvait supposer qu'il dût mentir. D'ailleurs pourquoi\\naurait-il menti?\\n\\n«Il faudra donc nous contenter, dit Beauchamp, de rendre à M. le comte\\ntous les petits services qui seront en notre pouvoir. Moi, en ma qualité\\nde journaliste, je lui ouvre tous les théâtres de Paris.\\n\\n--Merci, monsieur, dit en souriant Monte-Cristo; mon intendant a déjà\\nl'ordre de me louer une loge dans chacun d'eux.\\n\\n--Et votre intendant est-il aussi un Nubien, un muet? demanda Debray.\\n\\n--Non, monsieur, c'est tout bonnement un compatriote à vous, si tant\\nest cependant qu'un Corse soit compatriote de quelqu'un: mais vous le\\nconnaissez, monsieur de Morcerf.\\n\\n--Serait-ce par hasard le brave signor Bertuccio, qui s'entend si bien à\\nlouer les fenêtres?\\n\\n--Justement, et vous l'avez vu chez moi le jour où j'ai eu l'honneur de\\nvous recevoir à déjeuner. C'est un fort brave homme, qui a été un peu\\nsoldat, un peu contrebandier, un peu de tout ce qu'on peut être enfin.\\nJe ne jurerais même pas qu'il n'a point eu quelques démêlés avec la\\npolice pour une misère, quelque chose comme un coup de couteau.\\n\\n--Et vous avez choisi cet honnête citoyen du monde pour votre\\nintendant, monsieur le comte? dit Debray, combien vous vole-t-il par an?\\n\\n--Eh bien, parole d'honneur, dit le comte, pas plus qu'un autre, j'en\\nsuis sûr; mais il fait mon affaire, ne connaît pas d'impossibilité, et\\nje le garde.\\n\\n--Alors, dit Château-Renaud, vous voilà avec une maison montée: vous\\navez un hôtel aux Champs-Élysées, domestiques, intendant, il ne vous\\nmanque plus qu'une maîtresse.»\\n\\nAlbert sourit, il songeait à la belle Grecque qu'il avait vue dans la\\nloge du comte au théâtre Valle et au théâtre Argentina.\\n\\n«J'ai mieux que cela, dit Monte-Cristo: j'ai une esclave. Vous louez\\nvos maîtresses au théâtre de l'Opéra, au théâtre du Vaudeville, au\\nthéâtre des Variétés; moi, j'ai acheté la mienne à Constantinople; cela\\nm'a coûté plus, mais, sous ce rapport-là, je n'ai plus besoin de\\nm'inquiéter de rien.\\n\\n--Mais vous oubliez, dit en riant Debray, que nous sommes, comme l'a dit\\nle roi Charles, francs de nom, francs de nature; qu'en mettant le pied\\nsur la terre de France, votre esclave est devenue libre?\\n\\n--Qui le lui dira? demanda Monte-Cristo.\\n\\n--Mais, dame! le premier venu.\\n\\n--Elle ne parle que le romaïque.\\n\\n--Alors c'est autre chose.\\n\\n--Mais la verrons-nous, au moins? demanda Beauchamp, ou, ayant déjà un\\nmuet, avez-vous aussi des eunuques?\\n\\n--Ma foi non, dit Monte-Cristo, je ne pousse pas l'orientalisme\\njusque-là: tout ce qui m'entoure est libre de me quitter, et en me\\nquittant n'aura plus besoin de moi ni de personne; voilà peut-être\\npourquoi on ne me quitte pas.»\\n\\nDepuis longtemps on était passé au dessert et aux cigares.\\n\\n«Mon cher, dit Debray en se levant, il est deux heures et demie, votre\\nconvive est charmant, mais il n'y a si bonne compagnie qu'on ne quitte,\\net quelquefois même pour la mauvaise; il faut que je retourne à mon\\nministère. Je parlerai du comte au ministre, et il faudra bien que nous\\nsachions qui il est.\\n\\n--Prenez garde, dit Morcerf, les plus malins y ont renoncé.\\n\\n--Bah! nous avons trois millions pour notre police: il est vrai qu'ils\\nsont presque toujours dépensés à l'avance; mais n'importe; il restera\\ntoujours bien une cinquantaine de mille francs à mettre à cela.\\n\\n--Et quand vous saurez qui il est, vous me le direz?\\n\\n--Je vous le promets. Au revoir, Albert; messieurs, votre très humble.»\\n\\nEt, en sortant, Debray cria très haut dans l'antichambre:\\n\\n«Faites avancer!\\n\\n--Bon, dit Beauchamp à Albert, je n'irai pas à la Chambre, mais j'ai à\\noffrir à mes lecteurs mieux qu'un discours de M. Danglars.\\n\\n--De grâce, Beauchamp, dit Morcerf, pas un mot, je vous en supplie; ne\\nm'ôtez pas le mérite de le présenter et de l'expliquer: N'est-ce pas\\nqu'il est curieux?\\n\\n--Il est mieux que cela, répondit Château-Renaud, et c'est vraiment un\\ndes hommes les plus extraordinaires que j'aie vus de ma vie. Venez-vous,\\nMorrel?\\n\\n--Le temps de donner ma carte à M. le comte, qui veut bien me promettre\\nde venir nous faire une petite visite, rue Meslay, 14.\\n\\n--Soyez sûr que je n'y manquerai pas, monsieur», dit en s'inclinant le\\ncomte.\\n\\nEt Maximilien Morrel sortit avec le baron de Château-Renaud, laissant\\nMonte-Cristo seul avec Morcerf.\",\n",
       " 'XLI': \"Quand Albert se trouva en tête-à-tête avec Monte-Cristo:\\n\\n«Monsieur le comte, lui dit-il, permettez-moi de commencer avec vous mon\\nmétier de cicérone en vous donnant le spécimen d'un appartement de\\ngarçon. Habitué aux palais d'Italie, ce sera pour vous une étude à faire\\nque de calculer dans combien de pieds carrés peut vivre un des jeunes\\ngens de Paris qui ne passent pas pour être les plus mal logés. À mesure\\nque nous passerons d'une chambre à l'autre, nous ouvrirons les fenêtres\\npour que vous respiriez.»\\n\\nMonte-Cristo connaissait déjà la salle à manger et le salon du\\nrez-de-chaussée. Albert le conduisit d'abord à son atelier; c'était, on\\nse le rappelle, sa pièce de prédilection.\\n\\nMonte-Cristo était un digne appréciateur de toutes les choses qu'Albert\\navait entassées dans cette pièce: vieux bahuts, porcelaines du Japon,\\nétoffes d'Orient, verroteries de Venise, armes de tous les pays du\\nmonde, tout lui était familier, et, au premier coup d'oeil, il\\nreconnaissait le siècle, le pays et l'origine.\\n\\nMorcerf avait cru être l'explicateur, et c'était lui au contraire qui\\nfaisait, sous la direction du comte, un cours d'archéologie, de\\nminéralogie et d'histoire naturelle. On descendit au premier. Albert\\nintroduisit son hôte dans le salon. Ce salon était tapissé des oeuvres\\ndes peintres modernes; il y avait des paysages de Dupré, aux longs\\nroseaux, aux arbres élancés, aux vaches beuglantes et aux ciels\\nmerveilleux; il y avait des cavaliers arabes de Delacroix, aux longs\\nburnous blancs, aux ceintures brillantes, aux armes damasquinées, dont\\nles chevaux se mordaient avec rage, tandis que les hommes se déchiraient\\navec des masses de fer, des aquarelles de Boulanger, représentant tout\\n_Notre-Dame de Paris_ avec cette vigueur qui fait du peintre l'émule du\\npoète; il y avait des toiles de Diaz, qui fait les fleurs plus belles\\nque les fleurs, le soleil plus brillant que le soleil; des dessins de\\nDecamps, aussi colorés que ceux de Salvator Rosa, mais plus poétiques;\\ndes pastels de Giraud et de Muller, représentant des enfants aux têtes\\nd'ange, des femmes aux traits de vierge; des croquis arrachés à l'album\\ndu voyage d'Orient de Dauzats, qui avaient été crayonnés en quelques\\nsecondes sur la selle d'un chameau ou sous le dôme d'une mosquée; enfin\\ntout ce que l'art moderne peut donner en échange et en dédommagement de\\nl'art perdu et envolé avec les siècles précédents.\\n\\nAlbert s'attendait à montrer, cette fois du moins, quelque chose de\\nnouveau à l'étrange voyageur; mais à son grand étonnement, celui-ci,\\nsans avoir besoin de chercher les signatures, dont quelques-unes\\nd'ailleurs n'étaient présentes que par des initiales, appliqua à\\nl'instant même le nom de chaque auteur à son oeuvre, de façon qu'il\\nétait facile de voir que non seulement chacun de ces noms lui était\\nconnu, mais encore que chacun de ces talents avait été apprécié et\\nétudié par lui.\\n\\nDu salon on passa dans la chambre à coucher. C'était à la fois un modèle\\nd'élégance et de goût sévère: là un seul portrait, mais signé Léopold\\nRobert, resplendissait dans son cadre d'or mat.\\n\\nCe portrait attira tout d'abord les regards du comte de Monte-Cristo,\\ncar il fit trois pas rapides dans la chambre et s'arrêta tout à coup\\ndevant lui.\\n\\nC'était celui d'une jeune femme de vingt-cinq à vingt-six ans, au teint\\nbrun, au regard de feu, voilé sous une paupière languissante; elle\\nportait le costume pittoresque des pêcheuses catalanes avec son corset\\nrouge et noir et ses aiguilles d'or piquées dans les cheveux; elle\\nregardait la mer, et sa silhouette élégante se détachait sur le double\\nazur des flots et du ciel.\\n\\nIl faisait sombre dans la chambre, sans quoi Albert eût pu voir la\\npâleur livide qui s'étendit sur les joues du comte, et surprendre le\\nfrisson nerveux qui effleura ses épaules et sa poitrine.\\n\\nIl se fit un instant de silence, pendant lequel Monte-Cristo demeura\\nl'oeil obstinément fixé sur cette peinture.\\n\\n«Vous avez là une belle maîtresse, vicomte, dit Monte-Cristo d'une voix\\nparfaitement calme, et ce costume, costume de bal sans doute, lui sied\\nvraiment à ravir.\\n\\n--Ah! monsieur, dit Albert, voilà une méprise que je ne vous\\npardonnerais pas, si à côté de ce portrait vous en eussiez vu quelque\\nautre. Vous ne connaissez pas ma mère, monsieur; c'est elle que vous\\nvoyez dans ce cadre; elle se fit peindre ainsi, il y a six ou huit ans.\\nCe costume est un costume de fantaisie, à ce qu'il paraît, et la\\nressemblance est si grande, que je crois encore voir ma mère telle\\nqu'elle était en 1830. La comtesse fit faire ce portrait pendant une\\nabsence du comte. Sans doute elle croyait lui préparer pour son retour\\nune gracieuse surprise; mais, chose bizarre, ce portrait déplut à mon\\npère; et la valeur de la peinture, qui est, comme vous le voyez, une des\\nbelles toiles de Léopold Robert, ne put le faire passer sur l'antipathie\\ndans laquelle il l'avait prise. Il est vrai de dire entre nous, mon cher\\ncomte, que M. de Morcerf est un des pairs les plus assidus au\\nLuxembourg, un général renommé pour la théorie, mais un amateur d'art\\ndes plus médiocres; il n'en est pas de même de ma mère, qui peint d'une\\nfaçon remarquable, et qui, estimant trop une pareille oeuvre pour s'en\\nséparer tout à fait, me l'a donnée pour que chez moi elle fût moins\\nexposée à déplaire à M. de Morcerf, dont je vous ferai voir à son tour\\nle portrait peint par Gros. Pardonnez-moi si je vous parle ainsi ménage\\net famille, mais, comme je vais avoir l'honneur de vous conduire chez le\\ncomte, je vous dis cela pour qu'il ne vous échappe pas de vanter ce\\nportrait devant lui. Au reste, il a une funeste influence; car il est\\nbien rare que ma mère vienne chez moi sans le regarder, et plus rare\\nencore qu'elle le regarde sans pleurer. Le nuage qu'amena l'apparition\\nde cette peinture dans l'hôtel est du reste le seul qui se soit élevé\\nentre le comte et la comtesse, qui, quoique mariés depuis plus de vingt\\nans, sont encore unis comme au premier jour.»\\n\\nMonte-Cristo jeta un regard rapide sur Albert, comme pour chercher une\\nintention cachée à ses paroles; mais il était évident que le jeune homme\\nles avait dites dans toute la simplicité de son âme.\\n\\n«Maintenant, dit Albert, vous avez vu toutes mes richesses, monsieur le\\ncomte, permettez-moi de vous les offrir, si indignes qu'elles soient;\\nregardez-vous comme étant ici chez vous, et, pour vous mettre plus à\\nvotre aise encore, veuillez m'accompagner jusque chez M. de Morcerf, à\\nqui j'ai écrit de Rome le service que vous m'avez rendu, à qui j'ai\\nannoncé la visite que vous m'aviez promise; et, je puis le dire, le\\ncomte et la comtesse attendaient avec impatience qu'il leur fût permis\\nde vous remercier. Vous êtes un peu blasé sur toutes choses, je le sais,\\nmonsieur le comte, et les scènes de famille n'ont pas sur Simbad le\\nmarin beaucoup d'action: vous avez vu d'autres scènes! Cependant\\nacceptez que je vous propose, comme initiation à la vie parisienne, la\\nvie de politesses, de visites et de présentations.»\\n\\nMonte-Cristo s'inclina pour répondre; il acceptait la proposition sans\\nenthousiasme et sans regrets, comme une des convenances de société dont\\ntout homme comme il faut se fait un devoir. Albert appela son valet de\\nchambre, et lui ordonna d'aller prévenir M. et Mme de Morcerf de\\nl'arrivée prochaine du comte de Monte-Cristo.\\n\\nAlbert le suivit avec le comte.\\n\\nEn arrivant dans l'antichambre du comte, on voyait au-dessus de la porte\\nqui donnait dans le salon un écusson qui, par son entourage riche et son\\nharmonie avec l'ornementation de la pièce, indiquait l'importance que\\nle propriétaire de l'hôtel attachait à ce blason.\\n\\nMonte-Cristo s'arrêta devant ce blason, qu'il examina avec attention.\\n\\n«D'azur à sept merlettes d'or posées en bande. C'est sans doute l'écusson\\nde votre famille, monsieur? demanda-t-il. À part la connaissance des\\npièces du blason qui me permet de le déchiffrer, je suis fort ignorant\\nen matière héraldique, moi, comte de hasard, fabriqué par la Toscane à\\nl'aide d'une commanderie de Saint-Étienne, et qui me fusse passé d'être\\ngrand seigneur si l'on ne m'eût répété que, lorsqu'on voyage beaucoup,\\nc'est chose absolument nécessaire. Car enfin il faut bien, ne fût-ce que\\npour que les douaniers ne vous visitent pas, avoir quelque chose sur\\nles panneaux de sa voiture. Excusez-moi donc si je vous fais une\\npareille question.\\n\\n--Elle n'est aucunement indiscrète, monsieur, dit Morcerf avec la\\nsimplicité de la conviction, et vous aviez deviné juste: ce sont nos\\narmes, c'est-à-dire celles du chef de mon père; mais elles sont, comme\\nvous voyez, accolées à un écusson qui est de gueule à la tour d'argent,\\net qui est du chef de ma mère; par les femmes je suis Espagnol, mais la\\nmaison de Morcerf est française, et, à ce que j'ai entendu dire, même\\nune des plus anciennes du Midi de la France.\\n\\n--Oui, reprit Monte-Cristo, c'est ce qu'indiquent les merlettes. Presque\\ntous les pèlerins armés qui tentèrent ou qui firent la conquête de la\\nTerre Sainte prirent pour armes ou des croix, signe de la mission à la\\nquelle ils s'étaient voués, ou des oiseaux voyageurs, symbole du long\\nvoyage qu'ils allaient entreprendre et qu'ils espéraient accomplir sur\\nles ailes de la foi. Un de vos aïeux paternels aura été de quelqu'une de\\nvos croisades, et, en supposant que ce ne soit que celle de saint Louis,\\ncela nous fait déjà remonter au treizième siècle, ce qui est encore fort\\njoli.\\n\\n--C'est possible, dit Morcerf: il y a quelque part dans le cabinet de\\nmon père un arbre généalogique qui nous dira cela, et sur lequel j'avais\\nautrefois des commentaires qui eussent fort édifié d'Hozier et Jaucourt.\\nÀ présent, je n'y pense plus; cependant je vous dirai, monsieur le\\ncomte, et ceci rentre dans mes attributions de cicérone, que l'on\\ncommence à s'occuper beaucoup de ces choses-là sous notre gouvernement\\npopulaire.\\n\\n--Eh bien, alors, votre gouvernement aurait bien dû choisir dans son\\npassé quelque chose de mieux que ces deux pancartes que j'ai remarquées\\nsur vos monuments, et qui n'ont aucun sens héraldique. Quant à vous,\\nvicomte, reprit Monte-Cristo en revenant à Morcerf, vous êtes plus\\nheureux que votre gouvernement, car vos armes sont vraiment belles et\\nparlent à l'imagination. Oui, c'est bien cela, vous êtes à la fois de\\nProvence et d'Espagne; c'est ce qui explique, si le portrait que vous\\nm'avez montré est ressemblant, cette belle couleur brune que j'admirais\\nsi fort sur le visage de la noble Catalane.»\\n\\nIl eût fallu être Oedipe ou le Sphinx lui-même pour deviner l'ironie que\\nmit le comte dans ces paroles, empreintes en apparence de la plus grande\\npolitesse; aussi Morcerf le remercia-t-il d'un sourire, et, passant le\\npremier pour lui montrer le chemin, poussa-t-il la porte qui s'ouvrait\\nau-dessous de ses armes, et qui, ainsi que nous l'avons dit, donnait\\ndans le salon.\\n\\nDans l'endroit le plus apparent de ce salon se voyait aussi un portrait;\\nc'était celui d'un homme de trente-cinq à trente-huit ans, vêtu d'un\\nuniforme d'officier général, portant cette double épaulette en torsade,\\nsigne des grades supérieurs, le ruban de la Légion d'honneur au cou, ce\\nqui indiquait qu'il était commandeur, et sur la poitrine, à droite, la\\nplaque de grand officier de l'ordre du Sauveur, et, à gauche, celle de\\ngrand-croix de Charles III, ce qui indiquait que la personne représentée\\npar ce portrait avait dû faire les guerres de Grèce et d'Espagne, ou, ce\\nqui revient absolument au même en matière de cordons, avoir rempli\\nquelque mission diplomatique dans les deux pays.\\n\\nMonte-Cristo était occupé à détailler ce portrait avec non moins de soin\\nqu'il avait fait de l'autre, lorsqu'une porte latérale s'ouvrit, et\\nqu'il se trouva en face du comte de Morcerf lui-même.\\n\\nC'était un homme de quarante à quarante-cinq ans, mais qui en paraissait\\nau moins cinquante, et dont la moustache et les sourcils noirs\\ntranchaient étrangement avec des cheveux presque blancs coupés en brosse\\nà la mode militaire; il était vêtu en bourgeois et portait à sa\\nboutonnière un ruban dont les différents liserés rappelaient les\\ndifférents ordres dont il était décoré. Cet homme entra d'un pas assez\\nnoble et avec une sorte d'empressement. Monte-Cristo le vit venir à lui\\nsans faire un seul pas; on eût dit que ses pieds étaient cloués au\\nparquet comme ses yeux sur le visage du comte de Morcerf.\\n\\n«Mon père, dit le jeune homme, j'ai l'honneur de vous présenter monsieur\\nle comte de Monte-Cristo, ce généreux ami que j'ai eu le bonheur de\\nrencontrer dans les circonstances difficiles que vous savez.\\n\\n--Monsieur est le bienvenu parmi nous, dit le comte de Morcerf en\\nsaluant Monte-Cristo avec un sourire, et il a rendu à notre maison, en\\nlui conservant son unique héritier, un service qui sollicitera\\néternellement notre reconnaissance.»\\n\\nEt en disant ces paroles le comte de Morcerf indiquait un fauteuil à\\nMonte-Cristo, en même temps que lui-même s'asseyait en face de la\\nfenêtre.\\n\\nQuant à Monte-Cristo, tout en prenant le fauteuil désigné par le comte\\nde Morcerf, il s'arrangea de manière à demeurer caché dans l'ombre des\\ngrands rideaux de velours, et à lire de là sur les traits empreints de\\nfatigue et de soucis du comte toute une histoire de secrètes douleurs\\nécrites dans chacune de ses rides venues avec le temps.\\n\\n«Madame la comtesse, dit Morcerf, était à sa toilette lorsque le vicomte\\nl'a fait prévenir de la visite qu'elle allait avoir le bonheur de\\nrecevoir; elle va descendre, et dans dix minutes elle sera au salon.\\n\\n--C'est beaucoup d'honneur pour moi, dit Monte-Cristo, d'être ainsi,\\ndès le jour de mon arrivée à Paris, mis en rapport avec un homme dont le\\nmérite égale la réputation, et pour lequel la fortune, juste une fois,\\nn'a pas fait d'erreur; mais n'a-t-elle pas encore, dans les plaines de\\nla Mitidja ou dans les montagnes de l'Atlas, un bâton de maréchal à vous\\noffrir?\\n\\n--Oh! répliqua Morcerf en rougissant un peu, j'ai quitté le service,\\nmonsieur. Nommé pair sous la Restauration, j'étais de la première\\ncampagne, et je servais sous les ordres du maréchal de Bourmont; je\\npouvais donc prétendre à un commandement supérieur, et qui sait ce qui\\nfût arrivé si la branche aînée fût restée sur le trône! Mais la\\nrévolution de Juillet était, à ce qu'il paraît, assez glorieuse pour se\\npermettre d'être ingrate; elle le fut pour tout service qui ne datait\\npas de la période impériale; je donnai donc ma démission, car, lorsqu'on\\na gagné ses épaulettes sur le champ de bataille, on ne sait guère\\nmanoeuvrer sur le terrain glissant des salons; j'ai quitté l'épée, je me\\nsuis jeté dans la politique, je me voue à l'industrie, j'étudie les arts\\nutiles. Pendant les vingt années que j'étais resté au service, j'en\\navais bien eu le désir, mais je n'en avais pas eu le temps.\\n\\n--Ce sont de pareilles choses qui entretiennent la supériorité de votre\\nnation sur les autres pays, monsieur, répondit Monte-Cristo; gentilhomme\\nissu de grande maison, possédant une belle fortune, vous avez d'abord\\nconsenti à gagner les premiers grades en soldat obscur, c'est fort rare;\\npuis, devenu général, pair de France, commandeur de la Légion d'honneur,\\nvous consentez à recommencer un second apprentissage, sans autre espoir,\\nsans autre récompense que celle d'être un jour utile à vos\\nsemblables.... Ah! monsieur, voilà qui est vraiment beau; je dirai\\nplus, voilà qui est sublime.»\\n\\nAlbert regardait et écoutait Monte-Cristo avec étonnement; il n'était\\npas habitué à le voir s'élever à de pareilles idées d'enthousiasme.\\n\\n«Hélas! continua l'étranger, sans doute pour faire disparaître\\nl'imperceptible nuage que ces paroles venaient de faire passer sur le\\nfront de Morcerf, nous ne faisons pas ainsi en Italie, nous croissons\\nselon notre race et notre espèce, et nous gardons même feuillage, même\\ntaille, et souvent même inutilité toute notre vie.\\n\\n--Mais, monsieur, répondit le comte de Morcerf, pour un homme de votre\\nmérite, l'Italie n'est pas une patrie, et la France ne sera peut-être\\npas ingrate pour tout le monde; elle traite mal ses enfants, mais\\nd'habitude elle accueille grandement les étrangers.\\n\\n--Eh! mon père, dit Albert avec un sourire, on voit bien que vous ne\\nconnaissez pas M. le comte de Monte-Cristo. Ses satisfactions à lui sont\\nen dehors de ce monde; il n'aspire point aux honneurs, et en prend\\nseulement ce qui peut tenir sur un passeport.\\n\\n--Voilà, à mon égard, l'expression la plus juste que j'aie jamais\\nentendue, répondit l'étranger.\\n\\n--Monsieur a été le maître de son avenir, dit le comte de Morcerf avec\\nun soupir, et il a choisi le chemin de fleurs.\\n\\n--Justement, monsieur, répliqua Monte-Cristo avec un de ces sourires\\nqu'un peintre ne rendra jamais, et qu'un physiologiste désespéra\\ntoujours d'analyser.\\n\\n--Si je n'eusse craint de fatiguer monsieur le comte, dit le général,\\névidemment charmé des manières de Monte-Cristo, je l'eusse emmené à la\\nChambre; il y a aujourd'hui séance curieuse pour quiconque ne connaît\\npas nos sénateurs modernes.\\n\\n--Je vous serai fort reconnaissant, monsieur, si vous voulez bien me\\nrenouveler cette offre une autre fois; mais aujourd'hui l'on m'a flatté\\nde l'espoir d'être présenté à Mme la comtesse, et j'attendrai.\\n\\n--Ah! voici ma mère!» s'écria le vicomte.\\n\\nEn effet, Monte-Cristo, en se retournant vivement, vit Mme de Morcerf à\\nl'entrée du salon, au seuil de la porte opposée à celle par laquelle\\nétait entré son mari: immobile et pâle, elle laissa, lorsque\\nMonte-Cristo se retourna de son côté, tomber son bras qui, on ne sait\\npourquoi, s'était appuyé sur le chambranle doré, elle était là depuis\\nquelques secondes, et avait entendu les dernières paroles prononcées par\\nle visiteur ultramontain.\\n\\nCelui-ci se leva et salua profondément la comtesse, qui s'inclina à son\\ntour, muette et cérémonieuse.\\n\\n«Eh, mon Dieu! madame, demanda le comte, qu'avez vous donc? serait-ce\\npar hasard la chaleur de ce salon qui vous fait mal?\\n\\n--Souffrez-vous, ma mère?» s'écria le vicomte en s'élançant au-devant\\nde Mercédès.\\n\\nElle les remercia tous deux avec un sourire.\\n\\n«Non, dit-elle, mais j'ai éprouvé quelque émotion en voyant pour la\\npremière fois celui sans l'intervention duquel nous serions en ce moment\\ndans les larmes et dans le deuil. Monsieur, continua la comtesse en\\ns'avançant avec la majesté d'une reine, je vous dois la vie de mon fils,\\net pour ce bienfait je vous bénis. Maintenant je vous rends grâce pour\\nle plaisir que vous me faites en me procurant l'occasion de vous\\nremercier comme je vous ai béni, c'est-à-dire du fond du coeur.»\\n\\nLe comte s'inclina encore, mais plus profondément que la première fois;\\nil était plus pâle encore que Mercédès.\\n\\n«Madame, dit-il, M. le comte et vous me récompensez trop généreusement\\nd'une action bien simple. Sauver un homme, épargner un tourment à un\\npère, ménager la sensibilité d'une femme, ce n'est point faire une bonne\\noeuvre, c'est faire acte d'humanité.»\\n\\nÀ ces mots, prononcés avec une douceur et une politesse exquises, Mme de\\nMorcerf répondit avec un accent profond:\\n\\n«Il est bien heureux pour mon fils, monsieur, de vous avoir pour ami, et\\nje remercie Dieu qui a fait les choses ainsi.»\\n\\nEt Mercédès leva ses beaux yeux au ciel avec une gratitude si infinie,\\nque le comte crut y voir trembler deux larmes.\\n\\nM. de Morcerf s'approcha d'elle.\\n\\n«Madame, dit-il, j'ai déjà fait mes excuses à M. le comte d'être obligé\\nde le quitter, et vous les lui renouvellerez, je vous prie. La séance\\nouvre à deux heures, il en est trois, et je dois parler.\\n\\n--Allez, monsieur, je tâcherai de faire oublier votre absence à notre\\nhôte, dit la comtesse avec le même accent de sensibilité. Monsieur le\\ncomte, continua-t-elle en se retournant vers Monte-Cristo, nous fera-t-il\\nl'honneur de passer le reste de la journée avec nous?\\n\\n--Merci, madame, et vous me voyez, croyez-le bien, on ne peut plus\\nreconnaissant de votre offre; mais je suis descendu ce matin à votre\\nporte, de ma voiture de voyage. Comment suis-je installé à Paris, je\\nl'ignore; où le suis-je, je le sais à peine. C'est une inquiétude\\nlégère, je le sais, mais appréciable cependant.\\n\\n--Nous aurons ce plaisir une autre fois, au moins vous nous le\\npromettez?» demanda la comtesse.\\n\\nMonte-Cristo s'inclina sans répondre, mais le geste pouvait passer pour\\nun assentiment.\\n\\n«Alors, je ne vous retiens pas, monsieur, dit la comtesse, car je ne\\nveux pas que ma reconnaissance devienne ou une indiscrétion ou une\\nimportunité.\\n\\n--Mon cher comte, dit Albert, si vous le voulez bien, je vais essayer\\nde vous rendre à Paris votre gracieuse politesse de Rome, et mettre mon\\ncoupé à votre disposition jusqu'à ce que vous ayez eu le temps de monter\\nvos équipages.\\n\\n--Merci mille fois de votre obligeance, vicomte, dit Monte-Cristo, mais\\nje présume que M. Bertuccio aura convenablement employé les quatre\\nheures et demie que je viens de lui laisser, et que je trouverai à la\\nporte une voiture quelconque tout attelée.»\\n\\nAlbert était habitué à ces façons de la part du comte: il savait qu'il\\nétait, comme Néron, à la recherche de l'impossible, et il ne s'étonnait\\nplus de rien; seulement, il voulut juger par lui-même de quelle façon\\nses ordres avaient été exécutés, il l'accompagna donc jusqu'à la porte\\nde l'hôtel.\\n\\nMonte-Cristo ne s'était pas trompé: dès qu'il avait paru dans\\nl'antichambre du comte de Morcerf, un valet de pied, le même qui à Rome\\nétait venu apporter la carte du comte aux deux jeunes gens et leur\\nannoncer sa visite, s'était élancé hors du péristyle, de sorte qu'en\\narrivant au perron l'illustre voyageur trouva effectivement sa voiture\\nqui l'attendait.\\n\\nC'était un coupé sortant des ateliers de Keller, et un attelage dont\\nDrake avait, à la connaissance de tous les lions de Paris, refusé la\\nveille encore dix-huit mille francs.\\n\\n«Monsieur, dit le comte à Albert, je ne vous propose pas de\\nm'accompagner jusque chez moi, et je ne pourrais vous montrer qu'une\\nmaison improvisée, et j'ai, vous le savez, sous le rapport des\\nimprovisations, une réputation à ménager. Accordez-moi un jour et\\npermettez-moi alors de vous inviter. Je serai plus sûr de ne pas manquer\\naux lois de l'hospitalité.\\n\\n--Si vous me demandez un jour, monsieur le comte, je suis tranquille, ce\\nne sera plus une maison que vous me montrerez, ce sera un palais.\\nDécidément, vous avez quelque génie à votre disposition.\\n\\n--Ma foi, laissez-le croire, dit Monte-Cristo en mettant le pied sur les\\ndegrés garnis de velours de son splendide équipage, cela me fera quelque\\nbien auprès des dames.»\\n\\nEt il s'élança dans sa voiture, qui se referma derrière lui, et partit\\nau galop, mais pas si rapidement que le comte n'aperçut le mouvement\\nimperceptible qui fit trembler le rideau du salon où il avait laissé Mme\\nde Morcerf.\\n\\nLorsque Albert rentra chez sa mère, il trouva la comtesse au boudoir,\\nplongée dans un grand fauteuil de velours: toute la chambre, noyée\\nd'ombre, ne laissait apercevoir que la paillette étincelante attachée çà\\net là au ventre de quelque potiche ou à l'angle de quelque cadre d'or.\\n\\nAlbert ne put voir le visage de la comtesse perdu dans un nuage de gaze\\nqu'elle avait roulée autour de ses cheveux comme une auréole de vapeur;\\nmais il lui sembla que sa voix était altérée: il distingua aussi, parmi\\nles parfums des roses et des héliotropes de la jardinière, la trace\\nâpre et mordante des sels de vinaigre; sur une des coupes ciselées de la\\ncheminée en effet, le flacon de la comtesse, sorti de sa gaine de\\nchagrin, attira l'attention inquiète du jeune homme.\\n\\n«Souffrez-vous, ma mère? s'écria-t-il en entrant, et vous seriez-vous\\ntrouvée mal pendant mon absence?\\n\\n--Moi? non pas, Albert; mais, vous comprenez, ces roses, ces tubéreuses\\net ces fleurs d'oranger dégagent pendant ces premières chaleurs,\\nauxquelles on n'est pas habitué, de si violents parfums.\\n\\n--Alors, ma mère, dit Morcerf en portant la main à la sonnette, il faut\\nles faire porter dans votre antichambre. Vous êtes vraiment indisposée;\\ndéjà tantôt, quand vous êtes entrée, vous étiez fort pâle.\\n\\n--J'étais pâle, dites-vous, Albert?\\n\\n--D'une pâleur qui vous sied à merveille, ma mère, mais qui ne nous a\\npas moins effrayés pour cela, mon père et moi.\\n\\n--Votre père vous en a-t-il parlé? demanda vivement Mercédès.\\n\\n--Non, madame, mais c'est à vous-même, souvenez-vous, qu'il a fait cette\\nobservation.\\n\\n--Je ne me souviens pas», dit la comtesse.\\n\\nUn valet entra: il venait au bruit de la sonnette tirée par Albert.\\n\\n«Portez ces fleurs dans l'antichambre ou dans le cabinet de toilette,\\ndit le vicomte; elles font mal à Mme la comtesse.\\n\\nLe valet obéit.\\n\\nIl y eut un assez long silence, et qui dura pendant tout le temps que se\\nfit le déménagement.\\n\\n«Qu'est-ce donc que ce nom de Monte-Cristo? demanda la comtesse quand le\\ndomestique fut sorti emportant le dernier vase de fleurs, est-ce un nom\\nde famille, un nom de terre, un titre simple?\\n\\n--C'est, je crois, un titre, ma mère, et voilà tout. Le comte a acheté\\nune île dans l'archipel toscan, et a, d'après ce qu'il a dit lui-même ce\\nmatin, fondé une commanderie. Vous savez que cela se fait ainsi pour\\nSaint-Étienne de Florence, pour Saint-Georges-Constantinien de Parme, et\\nmême pour l'ordre de Malte. Au reste, il n'a aucune prétention à la\\nnoblesse et s'appelle un comte de hasard, quoique l'opinion générale de\\nRome soit que le comte est un très grand seigneur.\\n\\n--Ses manières sont excellentes, dit la comtesse, du moins d'après ce\\nque j'ai pu en juger par les courts instants pendant lesquels il est\\nresté ici.\\n\\n--Oh! parfaites, ma mère, si parfaites même qu'elles surpassent de\\nbeaucoup tout ce que j'ai connu de plus aristocratique dans les trois\\nnoblesses les plus fières de l'Europe, c'est-à-dire dans la noblesse\\nanglaise, dans la noblesse espagnole et dans la noblesse allemande.»\\n\\nLa comtesse réfléchit un instant, puis après cette courte hésitation\\nelle reprit:\\n\\n«Vous avez vu, mon cher Albert, c'est une question de mère que je vous\\nadresse là, vous le comprenez, vous avez vu M. de Monte-Cristo dans son\\nintérieur; vous avez de la perspicacité, vous avez l'habitude du monde,\\nplus de tact qu'on n'en a d'ordinaire à votre âge; croyez-vous que le\\ncomte soit ce qu'il paraît réellement être?\\n\\n--Et que paraît-il?\\n\\n--Vous l'avez dit vous-même à l'instant, un grand seigneur.\\n\\n--Je vous ai dit, ma mère, qu'on le tenait pour tel.\\n\\n--Mais qu'en pensez-vous, vous, Albert?\\n\\n--Je n'ai pas, je vous l'avouerai, d'opinion bien arrêtée sur lui; je le\\ncrois Maltais.\\n\\n--Je ne vous interroge pas sur son origine; je vous interroge sur sa\\npersonne.\\n\\n--Ah! sur sa personne, c'est autre chose; et j'ai vu tant de choses\\nétranges de lui, que si vous voulez que je vous dise ce que je pense, je\\nvous répondrai que je le regarderais volontiers comme un des hommes de\\nByron, que le malheur a marqué d'un sceau fatal; quelque Manfred,\\nquelque Lara, quelque Werner; comme un de ces débris enfin de quelque\\nvieille famille qui, déshérités de leur fortune paternelle, en ont\\ntrouvé une par la force de leur génie aventureux qui les a mis au-dessus\\ndes lois de la société.\\n\\n--Vous dites?...\\n\\n--Je dis que Monte-Cristo est une île au milieu de la Méditerranée, sans\\nhabitants, sans garnison, repaire de contrebandiers de toutes nations,\\nde pirates de tous pays. Qui sait si ces dignes industriels ne payent\\npas à leur seigneur un droit d'asile?\\n\\n--C'est possible, dit la comtesse rêveuse.\\n\\n--Mais n'importe, reprit le jeune homme, contrebandier ou non, vous en\\nconviendrez, ma mère, puisque vous l'avez vu, M. le comte de\\nMonte-Cristo est un homme remarquable et qui aura les plus grands succès\\ndans les salons de Paris. Et tenez, ce matin même, chez moi, il a\\ncommencé son entrée dans le monde en frappant de stupéfaction jusqu'à\\nChâteau-Renaud.\\n\\n--Et quel âge peut avoir le comte? demanda Mercédès, attachant\\nvisiblement une grande importance à cette question.\\n\\n--Il a trente-cinq à trente-six ans, ma mère.\\n\\n--Si jeune! c'est impossible, dit Mercédès répondant en même temps à ce\\nque lui disait Albert et à ce que lui disait sa propre pensée.\\n\\n--C'est la vérité, cependant. Trois ou quatre fois il m'a dit, et certes\\nsans préméditation, à telle époque j'avais cinq ans, à telle autre\\nj'avais dix ans, à telle autre douze; moi, que la curiosité tenait\\néveillé sur ces détails, je rapprochais les dates, et jamais je ne l'ai\\ntrouvé en défaut. L'âge de cet homme singulier, qui n'a pas d'âge, est\\ndonc, j'en suis sûr, de trente-cinq ans. Au surplus, rappelez-vous, ma\\nmère, combien son oeil est vif, combien ses cheveux sont noirs et\\ncombien son front, quoique pâle, est exempt de rides; c'est une nature\\nnon seulement vigoureuse, mais encore jeune.»\\n\\nLa comtesse baissa la tête comme sous un flot trop lourd d'amères\\npensées.\\n\\n«Et cet homme s'est pris d'amitié pour vous, Albert? demanda-t-elle avec\\nun frissonnement nerveux.\\n\\n--Je le crois, madame.\\n\\n--Et vous... l'aimez-vous aussi?\\n\\n--Il me plaît, madame, quoi qu'en dise Franz d'Épinay, qui voulait le\\nfaire passer à mes yeux pour un homme revenant de l'autre monde.»\\n\\nLa comtesse fit un mouvement de terreur.\\n\\n«Albert, dit-elle d'une voix altérée, je vous ai toujours mis en garde\\ncontre les nouvelles connaissances. Maintenant vous êtes homme, et vous\\npourriez me donner des conseils à moi-même; cependant je vous répète:\\nSoyez prudent, Albert.\\n\\n--Encore faudrait-il, chère mère, pour que le conseil me fût profitable,\\nque je susse d'avance de quoi me méfier. Le comte ne joue jamais, le\\ncomte ne boit que de l'eau dorée par une goutte de vin d'Espagne; le\\ncomte s'est annoncé si riche que, sans se faire rire au nez, il ne\\npourrait m'emprunter d'argent: que voulez-vous que je craigne de la part\\ndu comte?\\n\\n--Vous avez raison, dit la comtesse, et mes terreurs sont folles, ayant\\npour objet surtout un homme qui vous a sauvé la vie. À propos, votre\\npère l'a-t-il bien reçu, Albert? Il est important que nous soyons plus\\nque convenables avec le comte. M. de Morcerf est parfois occupé, ses\\naffaires le rendent soucieux, et il se pourrait que, sans le vouloir....\\n\\n--Mon père a été parfait, madame, interrompit Albert; je dirai plus: il\\na paru infiniment flatté de deux ou trois compliments des plus adroits\\nque le comte lui a glissés avec autant de bonheur que d'à-propos, comme\\ns'il l'eût connu depuis trente ans. Chacune de ces petites flèches\\nlouangeuses a dû chatouiller mon père, ajouta Albert en riant, de sorte\\nqu'ils se sont quittés les meilleurs amis du monde, que M. de Morcerf\\nvoulait même l'emmener à la Chambre pour lui faire entendre son\\ndiscours.»\\n\\nLa comtesse ne répondit pas; elle était absorbée dans une rêverie si\\nprofonde que ses yeux s'étaient fermés peu à peu. Le jeune homme, debout\\ndevant elle, la regardait avec cet amour filial plus tendre et plus\\naffectueux chez les enfants dont les mères sont jeunes et belles encore;\\npuis, après avoir vu ses yeux se fermer, il l'écouta respirer un instant\\ndans sa douce immobilité, et, la croyant assoupie, il s'éloigna sur la\\npointe du pied, poussant avec précaution la porte de la chambre où il\\nlaissait sa mère.\\n\\n«Ce diable d'homme, murmura-t-il en secouant la tête, je lui ai bien\\nprédit là-bas qu'il ferait sensation dans le monde: je mesure son effet\\nsur un thermomètre infaillible. Ma mère l'a remarqué, donc il faut\\nqu'il soit bien remarquable.»\\n\\nEt il descendit à ses écuries, non sans un dépit secret de ce que, sans\\ny avoir même songé, le comte de Monte-Cristo avait mis la main sur un\\nattelage qui renvoyait ses bais au numéro 2 dans l'esprit des\\nconnaisseurs.\\n\\n«Décidément, dit-il, les hommes ne sont pas égaux; il faudra que je prie\\nmon père de développer ce théorème à la Chambre haute.»\",\n",
       " 'XLII': \"Pendant ce temps le comte était arrivé chez lui; il avait mis six\\nminutes pour faire le chemin. Ces six minutes avaient suffi pour qu'il\\nfût vu de vingt jeunes gens qui, connaissant le prix de l'attelage\\nqu'ils n'avaient pu acheter eux-mêmes, avaient mis leur monture au galop\\npour entrevoir le splendide seigneur qui se donnait des chevaux de dix\\nmille francs la pièce.\\n\\nLa maison choisie par Ali, et qui devait servir de résidence de ville à\\nMonte-Cristo, était située à droite en montant les Champs-Élysées,\\nplacée entre cour et jardin; un massif fort touffu, qui s'élevait au\\nmilieu de la cour, masquait une partie de la façade, autour de ce\\nmassif s'avançaient, pareilles à deux bras, deux allées qui, s'étendant\\nà droite et à gauche, amenaient à partir de la grille, les voitures à un\\ndouble perron supportant à chaque marche un vase de porcelaine plein de\\nfleurs. Cette maison, isolée au milieu d'un large espace, avait, outre\\nl'entrée principale, une autre entrée donnant sur la rue de Ponthieu.\\n\\nAvant même que le cocher eût hélé le concierge, la grille massive roula\\nsur ses gonds; on avait vu venir le comte, et à Paris comme à Rome,\\ncomme partout, il était servi avec la rapidité de l'éclair. Le cocher\\nentra donc, décrivit le demi-cercle sans avoir ralenti son allure, et la\\ngrille était refermée déjà que les roues criaient encore sur le sable de\\nl'allée.\\n\\nAu côté gauche du perron la voiture s'arrêta; deux hommes parurent à la\\nportière: l'un était Ali, qui sourit à son maître avec une incroyable\\nfranchise de joie, et qui se trouva payé par un simple regard de\\nMonte-Cristo.\\n\\nL'autre salua humblement et présenta son bras au comte pour l'aider à\\ndescendre de la voiture.\\n\\n«Merci, monsieur Bertuccio, dit le comte en sautant légèrement les trois\\ndegrés du marchepied; et le notaire?\\n\\n--Il est dans le petit salon, Excellence, répondit Bertuccio.\\n\\n--Et les cartes de visite que je vous ai dit de faire graver dès que\\nvous auriez le numéro de la maison?\\n\\n--Monsieur le comte, c'est déjà fait; j'ai été chez le meilleur graveur\\ndu Palais-Royal, qui a exécuté la planche devant moi; la première carte\\ntirée a été portée à l'instant même, selon votre ordre, à M. le baron\\nDanglars, député, rue de la Chaussée-d'Antin, n° 7; les autres sont sur\\nla cheminée de la chambre à coucher de Votre Excellence.\\n\\n--Bien. Quelle heure est-il?\\n\\n--Quatre heures.»\\n\\nMonte-Cristo donna ses gants, son chapeau et sa canne à ce même laquais\\nfrançais qui s'était élancé hors de l'antichambre du comte de Morcerf\\npour appeler la voiture, puis il passa dans le petit salon conduit par\\nBertuccio, qui lui montra le chemin.\\n\\n«Voilà de pauvres marbres dans cette antichambre, dit Monte-Cristo,\\nj'espère bien qu'on m'enlèvera tout cela.»\\n\\nBertuccio s'inclina.\\n\\nComme l'avait dit l'intendant, le notaire attendait dans le petit salon.\\n\\nC'était une honnête figure de deuxième clerc de Paris, élevé à la\\ndignité infranchissable de tabellion de la banlieue.\\n\\n«Monsieur est le notaire chargé de vendre la maison de campagne que je\\nveux acheter? demanda Monte-Cristo.\\n\\n--Oui, monsieur le comte, répliqua le notaire.\\n\\n--L'acte de vente est-il prêt?\\n\\n--Oui, monsieur le comte.\\n\\n--L'avez-vous apporté?\\n\\n--Le voici.\\n\\n--Parfaitement. Et où est cette maison que j'achète», demanda\\nnégligemment Monte-Cristo, s'adressant moitié à Bertuccio, moitié au\\nnotaire.\\n\\nL'intendant fit un geste qui signifiait: Je ne sais pas.\\n\\nLe notaire regarda Monte-Cristo avec étonnement.\\n\\n«Comment, dit-il, monsieur le comte ne sait pas où est la maison qu'il\\nachète?\\n\\n--Non, ma foi, dit le comte.\\n\\n--Monsieur le comte ne la connaît pas?\\n\\n--Et comment diable la connaîtrais-je? j'arrive de Cadix ce matin, je\\nne suis jamais venu à Paris, c'est même la première fois que je mets le\\npied en France.\\n\\n--Alors c'est autre chose, répondit le notaire; la maison que monsieur\\nle comte achète est située à Auteuil.»\\n\\nÀ ces mots, Bertuccio pâlit visiblement.\\n\\n«Et où prenez-vous Auteuil? demanda Monte-Cristo.\\n\\n--À deux pas d'ici, monsieur le comte, dit le notaire, un peu après\\nPassy, dans une situation charmante, au milieu du bois de Boulogne.\\n\\n--Si près que cela! dit Monte-Cristo, mais ce n'est pas la campagne.\\nComment diable m'avez-vous été choisir une maison à la porte de Paris,\\nmonsieur Bertuccio?\\n\\n--Moi! s'écria l'intendant avec un étrange empressement; non, certes, ce\\nn'est pas moi que monsieur le comte a chargé de choisir cette maison;\\nque monsieur le comte veuille bien se rappeler, chercher dans sa\\nmémoire, interroger ses souvenirs.\\n\\n--Ah! c'est juste, dit Monte-Cristo; je me rappelle maintenant! j'ai lu\\ncette annonce dans un Journal, et je me suis laissé séduire par ce titre\\nmenteur: _Maison de campagne_.\\n\\n--Il est encore temps, dit vivement Bertuccio, et si Votre Excellence\\nveut me charger de chercher partout ailleurs, je lui trouverai ce qu'il\\ny aura de mieux, soit à Enghien, soit à Fontenay-aux-Roses, soit à\\nBellevue.\\n\\n--Non, ma foi, dit insoucieusement Monte-Cristo; puisque j'ai celle-là,\\nje la garderai.\\n\\n--Et monsieur a raison, dit vivement le notaire, qui craignait de perdre\\nses honoraires. C'est une charmante propriété: eaux vives, bois touffus,\\nhabitation confortable, quoique abandonnée depuis longtemps; sans\\ncompter le mobilier, qui, si vieux qu'il soit, a de la valeur, surtout\\naujourd'hui que l'on recherche les antiquailles. Pardon, mais je crois\\nque monsieur le comte a le goût de son époque.\\n\\n--Dites toujours, fit Monte-Cristo; c'est convenable, alors.\\n\\n--Ah! monsieur, c'est mieux que cela, c'est magnifique!\\n\\n--Peste! ne manquons pas une pareille occasion, dit Monte-Cristo; le\\ncontrat, s'il vous plaît, monsieur le notaire?»\\n\\nEt il signa rapidement, après avoir jeté un regard à l'endroit de l'acte\\noù étaient désignés la situation de la maison et les noms des\\npropriétaires.\\n\\n«Bertuccio, dit-il, donnez cinquante-cinq mille francs à monsieur.»\\n\\nL'intendant sortit d'un pas mal assuré, et revint avec une liasse de\\nbillets de banque que le notaire compta en homme qui a l'habitude de ne\\nrecevoir son argent qu'après la purge légale.\\n\\n«Et maintenant, demanda le comte, toutes les formalités sont-elles\\nremplies?\\n\\n--Toutes, monsieur le comte.\\n\\n--Avez-vous les clefs?\\n\\n--Elles sont aux mains du concierge qui garde la maison; mais voici\\nl'ordre que je lui ai donné d'installer monsieur dans sa propriété.\\n\\n--Fort bien.»\\n\\nEt Monte-Cristo fit au notaire un signe de tête qui voulait dire:\\n\\n«Je n'ai plus besoin de vous, allez-vous-en.»\\n\\n«Mais, hasarda l'honnête tabellion, monsieur le comte s'est trompé, il\\nme semble; ce n'est que cinquante mille francs, tout compris.\\n\\n--Et vos honoraires?\\n\\n--Se trouvent payés moyennant cette somme, monsieur le comte.\\n\\n--Mais n'êtes-vous pas venu d'Auteuil ici?\\n\\n--Oui, sans doute.\\n\\n--Eh bien, il faut bien vous payer votre dérangement», dit le comte.\\n\\nEt il le congédia du geste.\\n\\nLe notaire sortit à reculons et en saluant jusqu'à terre; c'était la\\npremière fois, depuis le jour où il avait pris ses inscriptions, qu'il\\nrencontrait un pareil client.\\n\\n«Conduisez monsieur», dit le comte à Bertuccio.\\n\\nEt l'intendant sortit derrière le notaire.\\n\\nÀ peine le comte fut-il seul qu'il sortit de sa poche un portefeuille à\\nserrure, qu'il ouvrit avec une petite clef attachée à son cou et qui ne\\nle quittait jamais.\\n\\nAprès avoir cherché un instant, il s'arrêta à un feuillet qui portait\\nquelques notes, confronta ces notes avec l'acte de vente déposé sur la\\ntable, et, recueillant ses souvenirs:\\n\\n«Auteuil, rue de la Fontaine, n° 28; c'est bien cela, dit-il; maintenant\\ndois-je m'en rapporter à un aveu arraché par la terreur religieuse ou\\npar la terreur physique? Au reste, dans une heure je saurai tout.\\nBertuccio! cria-t-il en frappant avec une espèce de petit marteau à\\nmanche pliant sur un timbre qui rendit un son aigu et prolongé pareil à\\ncelui d'un tam-tam, Bertuccio!»\\n\\nL'intendant parut sur le seuil.\\n\\n«Monsieur Bertuccio, dit le comte, ne m'avez-vous pas dit autrefois que\\nvous aviez voyagé en France?\\n\\n--Dans certaines parties de la France, oui, Excellence.\\n\\n--Vous connaissez les environs de Paris, sans doute?\\n\\n--Non, Excellence, non, répondit l'intendant avec une sorte de\\ntremblement nerveux que Monte-Cristo, connaisseur en fait d'émotions,\\nattribua avec raison à une vive inquiétude.\\n\\n--C'est fâcheux, dit-il, que vous n'ayez jamais visité les environs de\\nParis, car je veux aller ce soir même voir ma nouvelle propriété, et en\\nvenant avec moi vous m'eussiez donné sans doute d'utiles renseignements.\\n\\n--À Auteuil? s'écria Bertuccio dont le teint cuivré devint presque\\nlivide. Moi, aller à Auteuil!\\n\\n--Eh bien, qu'y a-t-il d'étonnant que vous veniez à Auteuil, je vous le\\ndemande? Quand je demeurerai à Auteuil, il faudra bien que vous y\\nveniez, puisque vous faites partie de la maison.»\\n\\nBertuccio baissa la tête devant le regard impérieux du maître, et il\\ndemeura immobile et sans réponse.\\n\\n«Ah çà! mais, que vous arrive-t-il. Vous allez donc me faire sonner une\\nseconde fois pour la voiture?» dit Monte-Cristo du ton que Louis XIV mit\\nà prononcer le fameux: «J'ai failli attendre!»\\n\\nBertuccio ne fit qu'un bond du petit salon à l'antichambre, et cria\\nd'une voix rauque:\\n\\n«Les chevaux de son Excellence!»\\n\\nMonte-Cristo écrivit deux ou trois lettres; comme il cachetait la\\ndernière, l'intendant reparut.\\n\\n«La voiture de son Excellence est à la porte, dit-il.\\n\\n--Eh bien, prenez vos gants et votre chapeau, dit Monte-Cristo.\\n\\n--Est-ce que je vais avec monsieur le comte? s'écria Bertuccio.\\n\\n--Sans doute, il faut bien que vous donniez vos ordres, puisque je\\ncompte habiter cette maison.»\\n\\nIl était sans exemple que l'on eût répliqué à une injonction du comte;\\naussi l'intendant, sans faire aucune objection, suivit-il son maître,\\nqui monta dans la voiture et lui fit signe de le suivre. L'intendant\\ns'assit respectueusement sur la banquette du devant.\",\n",
       " 'XLIII': \"Monte-Cristo avait remarqué qu'en descendant le perron, Bertuccio\\ns'était signé à la manière des Corses, c'est-à-dire en coupant l'air en\\ncroix avec le pouce, et qu'en prenant sa place dans la voiture il avait\\nmarmotté tout bas une courte prière. Tout autre qu'un homme curieux eût\\neu pitié de la singulière répugnance manifestée par le digne intendant\\npour la promenade méditée _extra muros_ par le comte; mais, à ce qu'il\\nparaît, celui-ci était trop curieux pour dispenser Bertuccio de ce\\npetit voyage.\\n\\nEn vingt minutes on fut à Auteuil. L'émotion de l'intendant avait été\\ntoujours croissant. En entrant dans le village, Bertuccio, rencogné dans\\nl'angle de la voiture, commença à examiner avec une émotion fiévreuse\\nchacune des maisons devant lesquelles on passait.\\n\\n«Vous ferez arrêter rue de la Fontaine, au n° 28», dit le comte en\\nfixant impitoyablement son regard sur l'intendant, auquel il donnait cet\\nordre.\\n\\nLa sueur monta au visage de Bertuccio; cependant il obéit, et, se\\npenchant en dehors de la voiture, il cria au cocher:\\n\\n«Rue de la Fontaine, n° 28.»\\n\\nCe n° 28 était situé à l'extrémité du village. Pendant le voyage, la\\nnuit était venue, ou plutôt un nuage noir tout chargé d'électricité\\ndonnait à ces ténèbres prématurées l'apparence et la solennité d'un\\népisode dramatique.\\n\\nLa voiture s'arrêta et le valet de pied se précipita à la portière,\\nqu'il ouvrit.\\n\\n«Eh bien, dit le comte, vous ne descendez pas, monsieur Bertuccio? vous\\nrestez donc dans la voiture alors? Mais à quoi diable songez-vous donc\\nce soir?»\\n\\nBertuccio se précipita par la portière et présenta son épaule au comte\\nqui, cette fois, s'appuya dessus et descendit un à un les trois degrés\\ndu marchepied.\\n\\n«Frappez, dit le comte, et annoncez-moi.»\\n\\nBertuccio frappa, la porte s'ouvrit et le concierge parut.\\n\\n«Qu'est-ce que c'est? demanda-t-il.\\n\\n--C'est votre nouveau maître, brave homme», dit le valet de pied.\\n\\nEt il tendit au concierge le billet de reconnaissance donné par le\\nnotaire.\\n\\n«La maison est donc vendue? demanda le concierge, et c'est monsieur qui\\nvient l'habiter?\\n\\n--Oui, mon ami, dit le comte, et je tâcherai que vous n'ayez pas à\\nregretter votre ancien maître.\\n\\n--Oh! monsieur, dit le concierge, je n'aurai pas à le regretter\\nbeaucoup, car nous le voyons bien rarement; il y a plus de cinq ans\\nqu'il n'est venu, et il a, ma foi! bien fait de vendre une maison qui ne\\nlui rapportait absolument rien.\\n\\n--Et comment se nommait votre ancien maître? demanda Monte-Cristo.\\n\\n--M. le marquis de Saint-Méran; ah! il n'a pas vendu la maison ce\\nqu'elle lui a coûté, j'en suis sûr.\\n\\n--Le marquis de Saint-Méran! reprit Monte-Cristo; mais il me semble que\\nce nom ne m'est pas inconnu, dit le comte; le marquis de Saint-Méran....\\n\\nEt il parut chercher.\\n\\n«Un vieux gentilhomme, continua le concierge, un fidèle serviteur des\\nBourbons, il avait une fille unique qu'il avait mariée à M. de\\nVillefort, qui a été procureur du roi à Nîmes et ensuite à Versailles.»\\n\\nMonte-Cristo jeta un regard qui rencontra Bertuccio plus livide que le\\nmur contre lequel il s'appuyait pour ne pas tomber.\\n\\n«Et cette fille n'est-elle pas morte? demanda Monte-Cristo; il me semble\\nque j'ai entendu dire cela.\\n\\n--Oui, monsieur, il y a vingt et un ans, et depuis ce temps-là nous\\nn'avons pas revu trois fois le pauvre cher marquis.\\n\\n--Merci, merci, dit Monte-Cristo, jugeant à la prostration de\\nl'intendant qu'il ne pouvait tendre davantage cette corde sans risquer\\nde la briser; merci! Donnez-moi de la lumière, brave homme.\\n\\n--Accompagnerai-je monsieur?\\n\\n--Non, c'est inutile, Bertuccio m'éclairera.\\n\\nEt Monte-Cristo accompagna ces paroles du don de deux pièces d'or qui\\nsoulevèrent une explosion de bénédictions et de soupirs.\\n\\n«Ah! monsieur! dit le concierge après avoir cherché inutilement sur le\\nrebord de la cheminée et sur les planches y attenantes, c'est que je\\nn'ai pas de bougies ici.\\n\\n--Prenez une des lanternes de la voiture, Bertuccio, et montrez-moi les\\nappartements», dit le comte.\\n\\nL'intendant obéit sans observation, mais il était facile à voir, au\\ntremblement de la main qui tenait la lanterne, ce qu'il lui en coûtait\\npour obéir.\\n\\nOn parcourut un rez-de-chaussée assez vaste; un premier étage composé\\nd'un salon, d'une salle de bain et de deux chambres à coucher. Par une\\nde ces chambres à coucher, on arrivait à un escalier tournant dont\\nl'extrémité aboutissait au jardin.\\n\\n«Tiens, voilà un escalier de dégagement, dit le comte, c'est assez\\ncommode. Éclairez-moi, monsieur Bertuccio; passez devant, et allons où\\ncet escalier nous conduira.\\n\\n--Monsieur, dit Bertuccio, il va au jardin.\\n\\n--Et comment savez-vous cela, je vous prie?\\n\\n--C'est-à-dire qu'il doit y aller.\\n\\n--Eh bien, assurons-nous-en.»\\n\\nBertuccio poussa un soupir et marcha devant. L'escalier aboutissait\\neffectivement au jardin.\\n\\nÀ la porte extérieure l'intendant s'arrêta.\\n\\n«Allons donc, monsieur Bertuccio!» dit le comte.\\n\\nMais celui auquel il s'adressait était abasourdi, stupide, anéanti. Ses\\nyeux égarés cherchaient tout autour de lui comme les traces d'un passé\\nterrible, et de ses mains crispées il semblait essayer de repousser des\\nsouvenirs affreux.\\n\\n«Eh bien? insista le comte.\\n\\n--Non! non! s'écria Bertuccio en posant la main à l'angle du mur\\nintérieur; non, monsieur, je n'irai pas plus loin, c'est impossible!\\n\\n--Qu'est-ce à dire? articula la voix irrésistible de Monte-Cristo.\\n\\n--Mais vous voyez bien, monsieur, s'écria l'intendant, que cela n'est\\npoint naturel; qu'ayant une maison à acheter à Paris, vous l'achetiez\\njustement à Auteuil, et que l'achetant à Auteuil, cette maison soit le\\nn° 28 de la rue de la Fontaine! Ah! pourquoi ne vous ai-je pas tout dit\\nlà-bas, monseigneur. Vous n'auriez certes pas exigé que je vinsse.\\nJ'espérais que la maison de monsieur le comte serait une autre maison\\nque celle-ci. Comme s'il n'y avait d'autre maison à Auteuil que celle de\\nl'assassinat!\\n\\n--Oh! oh! fit Monte-Cristo s'arrêtant tout à coup, quel vilain mot\\nvenez-vous de prononcer là! Diable d'homme! Corse enraciné! toujours des\\nmystères ou des superstitions! Voyons, prenez cette lanterne et visitons\\nle jardin; avec moi vous n'aurez pas peur, j'espère!»\\n\\nBertuccio ramassa la lanterne et obéit.\\n\\nLa porte en s'ouvrant, découvrit un ciel blafard dans lequel la lune\\ns'efforçait vainement de lutter contre une mer de nuages qui la\\ncouvraient de leurs flots sombres qu'elle illuminait un instant, et qui\\nallaient ensuite se perdre, plus sombres encore, dans les profondeurs de\\nl'infini.\\n\\nL'intendant voulut appuyer sur la gauche.\\n\\n«Non pas, monsieur, dit Monte-Cristo, à quoi bon suivre les allées?\\nvoici une belle pelouse, allons devant nous.»\\n\\nBertuccio essuya la sueur qui coulait de son front, mais obéit;\\ncependant, il continuait de prendre à gauche. Monte-Cristo, au\\ncontraire, appuyait à droite. Arrivé près d'un massif d'arbres, il\\ns'arrêta.\\n\\nL'intendant n'y put tenir.\\n\\n«Éloignez-vous, monsieur! s'écria-t-il, éloignez-vous, je vous en\\nsupplie, vous êtes justement à la place!\\n\\n--À quelle place?\\n\\n--À la place même où il est tombé.\\n\\n--Mon cher monsieur Bertuccio, dit Monte-Cristo en riant, revenez à\\nvous, je vous y engage; nous ne sommes pas ici à Sartène ou à Corte.\\nCeci n'est point un maquis, mais un jardin anglais, mal entretenu, j'en\\nconviens, mais qu'il ne faut pas calomnier pour cela.\\n\\n--Monsieur, ne restez pas là! ne restez pas là! je vous en supplie.\\n\\n--Je crois que vous devenez fou, maître Bertuccio, dit froidement le\\ncomte; si cela est, prévenez-moi car je vous ferai enfermer dans quelque\\nmaison de santé avant qu'il arrive un malheur.\\n\\n--Hélas! Excellence, dit Bertuccio en secouant la tête et en joignant\\nles mains avec une attitude qui eût fait rire le comte, si des pensées\\nd'un intérêt supérieur ne l'eussent captivé en ce moment et rendu fort\\nattentif aux moindres expansions de cette conscience timorée. Hélas!\\nExcellence, le malheur est arrivé.\\n\\n--Monsieur Bertuccio, dit le comte, je suis fort aise de vous dire que,\\ntout en gesticulant, vous vous tordez les bras, et que vous roulez des\\nyeux comme un possédé du corps duquel le diable ne veut pas sortir; or,\\nj'ai presque toujours remarqué que le diable le plus entêté à rester à\\nson poste, c'est un secret. Je vous savais Corse, je vous savais sombre\\net ruminant toujours quelque vieille histoire de vendetta, et je vous\\npassais cela en Italie, parce qu'en Italie ces sortes de choses sont de\\nmise, mais en France on trouve généralement l'assassinat de fort mauvais\\ngoût: il y a des gendarmes qui s'en occupent, des juges qui le\\ncondamnent et des échafauds qui le vengent.»\\n\\nBertuccio joignit les mains et, comme en exécutant ces différentes\\névolutions il ne quittait point sa lanterne, la lumière éclaira son\\nvisage bouleversé.\\n\\nMonte-Cristo l'examina du même oeil qu'à Rome il avait examiné le\\nsupplice d'Andrea; puis, d'un ton de voix qui fit courir un nouveau\\nfrisson par le corps du pauvre intendant:\\n\\n«L'abbé Busoni m'avait donc menti, dit-il, lorsque après son voyage en\\nFrance, en 1829, il vous envoya vers moi, muni d'une lettre de\\nrecommandation dans laquelle il me recommandait vos précieuses qualités.\\nEh bien, je vais écrire à l'abbé; je le rendrai responsable de son\\nprotégé, et je saurai sans doute ce que c'est que toute cette affaire\\nd'assassinat. Seulement, je vous préviens, monsieur Bertuccio, que\\nlorsque je vis dans un pays, j'ai l'habitude de me conformer à ses lois,\\net que je n'ai pas envie de me brouiller pour vous avec la justice de\\nFrance.\\n\\n--Oh! ne faites pas cela, Excellence, je vous ai servi fidèlement,\\nn'est-ce pas? s'écria Bertuccio au désespoir, j'ai toujours été honnête\\nhomme, et j'ai même, le plus que j'ai pu, fait de bonnes actions.\\n\\n--Je ne dis pas non, reprit le comte, mais pourquoi diable êtes-vous\\nagité de la sorte? C'est mauvais signe: une conscience pure n'amène pas\\ntant de pâleur sur les joues, tant de fièvre dans les mains d'un\\nhomme....\\n\\n--Mais, monsieur le comte, reprit en hésitant Bertuccio, ne m'avez-vous\\npas dit vous-même que M. l'abbé Busoni, qui a entendu ma confession dans\\nles prisons de Nîmes, vous avait prévenu, en m'envoyant chez vous, que\\nj'avais un lourd reproche à me faire?\\n\\n--Oui, mais comme il vous adressait à moi en me disant que vous feriez\\nun excellent intendant, j'ai cru que vous aviez volé, voilà tout!\\n\\n--Oh! monsieur le comte! fit Bertuccio avec mépris.\\n\\n--Ou que, comme vous étiez Corse, vous n'aviez pu résister au désir de\\nfaire une peau, comme on dit dans le pays par antiphrase, quand au\\ncontraire on en défait une.\\n\\n--Eh bien, oui, monseigneur, oui, mon bon seigneur, c'est cela! s'écria\\nBertuccio en se jetant aux genoux du comte; oui, c'est une vengeance, je\\nle jure, une simple vengeance.\\n\\n--Je comprends, mais ce que je ne comprends pas, c'est que ce soit cette\\nmaison justement qui vous galvanise à ce point.\\n\\n--Mais, monseigneur, n'est-ce pas bien naturel, reprit Bertuccio,\\npuisque c'est dans cette maison que la vengeance s'est accomplie?\\n\\n--Quoi! ma maison!\\n\\n--Oh! monseigneur, elle n'était pas encore à vous, répondit naïvement\\nBertuccio.\\n\\n--Mais à qui donc était-elle? à M. le marquis de Saint-Méran, nous a\\ndit, je crois, le concierge. Que diable aviez-vous donc à vous venger du\\nmarquis de Saint-Méran?\\n\\n--Oh! ce n'était pas de lui, monseigneur, c'était d'un autre.\\n\\n--Voilà une étrange rencontre, dit Monte-Cristo paraissant céder à ses\\nréflexions, que vous vous trouviez comme cela par hasard, sans\\npréparation aucune, dans une maison où s'est passée une scène qui vous\\ndonne de si affreux remords.\\n\\n--Monseigneur, dit l'intendant, c'est la fatalité qui amène tout cela,\\nj'en suis bien sûr: d'abord, vous achetez une maison juste à Auteuil,\\ncette maison est celle où j'ai commis un assassinat; vous descendez au\\njardin juste par l'escalier où il est descendu; vous vous arrêtez juste\\nà l'endroit où il reçut le coup; à deux pas, sous ce platane, était la\\nfosse où il venait d'enterrer l'enfant: tout cela n'est pas du hasard,\\nnon, car en ce cas le hasard ressemblerait trop à la Providence.\\n\\n--Eh bien, voyons, monsieur le Corse, supposons que ce soit la\\nProvidence; je suppose toujours tout ce qu'on veut, moi; d'ailleurs aux\\nesprits malades il faut faire des concessions. Voyons, rappelez vos\\nesprits et racontez-moi cela.\\n\\n--Je ne l'ai jamais raconté qu'une fois, et c'était à l'abbé Busoni. De\\npareilles choses, ajouta Bertuccio en secouant la tête, ne se disent que\\nsous le sceau de la confession.\\n\\n--Alors, mon cher Bertuccio, dit le comte, vous trouverez bon que je\\nvous renvoie à votre confesseur; vous vous ferez avec lui chartreux ou\\nbernardin, et vous causerez de vos secrets. Mais, moi, j'ai peur d'un\\nhôte effrayé par de pareils fantômes; je n'aime point que mes gens\\nn'osent point se promener le soir dans mon jardin. Puis, je l'avoue, je\\nserais peu curieux de quelque visite de commissaire de police; car,\\napprenez ceci, maître Bertuccio: en Italie, on ne paie la justice que si\\nelle se tait, mais en France on ne la paie au contraire que quand elle\\nparle. Peste! je vous croyais bien un peu Corse, beaucoup contrebandier,\\nfort habile intendant, mais je vois que vous avez encore d'autres cordes\\nà votre arc. Vous n'êtes plus à moi, monsieur Bertuccio.\\n\\n--Oh! monseigneur! monseigneur! s'écria l'intendant frappé de terreur à\\ncette menace; oh! s'il ne tient qu'à cela que je demeure à votre\\nservice, je parlerai, je dirai tout; et si je vous quitte, eh bien,\\nalors ce sera pour marcher à l'échafaud.\\n\\n--C'est différent alors, dit Monte-Cristo; mais si vous voulez mentir,\\nréfléchissez-y: mieux vaut que vous ne parliez pas du tout.\\n\\n--Non, monsieur, je vous le jure sur le salut de mon âme, je vous dirai\\ntout! car l'abbé Busoni lui-même n'a su qu'une partie de mon secret.\\nMais d'abord, je vous en supplie, éloignez-vous de ce platane; tenez, la\\nlune va blanchir ce nuage, et là, placé comme vous l'êtes, enveloppé de\\nce manteau qui me cache votre taille et qui ressemble à celui de M. de\\nVillefort!...\\n\\n--Comment! s'écria Monte-Cristo, c'est M. de Villefort....\\n\\n--Votre excellence le connaît?\\n\\n--L'ancien procureur du roi de Nîmes?\\n\\n--Oui.\\n\\n--Qui avait épousé la fille du marquis de Saint-Méran?\\n\\n--Oui.\\n\\n--Et qui avait dans le barreau la réputation du plus honnête, du plus\\nsévère, du plus rigide magistrat.\\n\\n--Eh bien, monsieur, s'écria Bertuccio, cet homme à la réputation\\nirréprochable....\\n\\n--Oui.\\n\\n--C'était un infâme.\\n\\n--Bah! dit Monte-Cristo, impossible.\\n\\n--Cela est pourtant comme je vous le dis.\\n\\n--Ah! vraiment! dit Monte-Cristo, et vous en avez la preuve?\\n\\n--Je l'avais du moins.\\n\\n--Et vous l'avez perdue, maladroit?\\n\\n--Oui; mais en cherchant bien on peut la retrouver.\\n\\n--En vérité! dit le comte, contez-moi cela, monsieur Bertuccio, car cela\\ncommence véritablement à m'intéresser.»\\n\\nEt le comte, en chantonnant un petit air de la _Lucia_, alla s'asseoir\\nsur un banc, tandis que Bertuccio le suivait en rappelant ses souvenirs.\\n\\nBertuccio resta debout devant lui.\",\n",
       " 'XLIV': \"«D'où monsieur le comte désire-t-il que je reprenne les choses? demanda\\nBertuccio.\\n\\n--Mais d'où vous voudrez, dit Monte-Cristo, puisque je ne sais absolument\\nrien.\\n\\n--Je croyais cependant que M. l'abbé Busoni avait dit à Votre\\nExcellence....\\n\\n--Oui, quelques détails sans doute, mais sept ou huit ans ont passé\\nlà-dessus, et j'ai oublié tout cela.\\n\\n--Alors je puis donc, sans crainte d'ennuyer Votre Excellence....\\n\\n--Allez, monsieur Bertuccio, allez, vous me tiendrez lieu de journal du\\nsoir.\\n\\n--Les choses remontent à 1815.\\n\\n--Ah! ah! fit Monte-Cristo, ce n'est pas hier, 1815.\\n\\n--Non, monsieur, et cependant les moindres détails me sont aussi\\nprésents à la mémoire que si nous étions seulement au lendemain. J'avais\\nun frère, un frère aîné, qui était au service de l'empereur. Il était\\ndevenu lieutenant dans un régiment composé entièrement de Corses. Ce\\nfrère était mon unique ami; nous étions restés orphelins, moi à cinq\\nans, lui à dix-huit, il m'avait élevé comme si j'eusse été son fils. En\\n1814, sous les Bourbons, il s'était marié; l'Empereur revint de l'île\\nd'Elbe, mon frère reprit aussitôt du service, et, blessé légèrement à\\nWaterloo, il se retira avec l'armée derrière la Loire.\\n\\n--Mais c'est l'histoire des Cent-Jours que vous me faites là, monsieur\\nBertuccio, dit le comte, et elle est déjà faite, si je ne me trompe.\\n\\n--Excusez-moi, Excellence, mais ces premiers détails sont nécessaires,\\net vous m'avez promis d'être patient.\\n\\n--Allez! allez! je n'ai qu'une parole.\\n\\n--Un jour, nous reçûmes une lettre, il faut vous dire que nous habitions\\nle petit village de Rogliano, à l'extrémité du cap Corse: cette lettre\\nétait de mon frère; il nous disait que l'armée était licenciée et qu'il\\nrevenait par Châteauroux, Clermont-Ferrand, le Puy et Nîmes; si j'avais\\nquelque argent, il me priait de le lui faire tenir à Nîmes, chez un\\naubergiste de notre connaissance, avec lequel j'avais quelques\\nrelations.\\n\\n--De contrebande, reprit Monte-Cristo.\\n\\n--Eh! mon Dieu! monsieur le comte, il faut bien.\\n\\n--Certainement, continuez donc.\\n\\n--J'aimais tendrement mon frère, je vous l'ai dit, Excellence; aussi je\\nrésolus non pas de lui envoyer l'argent, mais de le lui porter moi-même.\\nJe possédais un millier de francs, j'en laissai cinq cents à Assunta,\\nc'était ma belle-soeur; je pris les cinq cents autres, et je me mis en\\nroute pour Nîmes. C'était chose facile, j'avais ma barque, un chargement\\nà faire en mer; tout secondait mon projet. Mais le chargement fait, le\\nvent devint contraire, de sorte que nous fûmes quatre ou cinq jours sans\\npouvoir entrer dans le Rhône. Enfin nous y parvînmes; nous remontâmes\\njusqu'à Arles; je laissai la barque entre Bellegarde et Beaucaire, et je\\npris le chemin de Nîmes.\\n\\n--Nous arrivons, n'est-ce pas?\\n\\n--Oui, monsieur: excusez-moi, mais, comme Votre Excellence le verra, je\\nne lui dis que les choses absolument nécessaires. Or, c'était le moment\\noù avaient lieu les fameux massacres du Midi. Il y avait là deux ou\\ntrois brigands que l'on appelait Trestaillon, Truphemy et Graffan, qui\\négorgeaient dans les rues tous ceux qu'on soupçonnait de bonapartisme.\\nSans doute, monsieur le comte a entendu parler de ces assassinats?\\n\\n--Vaguement, j'étais fort loin de la France à cette époque. Continuez.\\n\\n--En entrant à Nîmes, on marchait littéralement dans le sang; à chaque\\npas on rencontrait des cadavres: les assassins, organisés par bandes,\\ntuaient, pillaient et brûlaient.\\n\\n«À la vue de ce carnage, un frisson me prit, non pas pour moi; moi,\\nsimple pêcheur corse, je n'avais pas grand-chose à craindre; au\\ncontraire, ce temps-là, c'était notre bon temps, à nous autres\\ncontrebandiers, mais pour mon frère, pour mon frère soldat de l'Empire,\\nrevenant de l'armée de la Loire avec son uniforme et ses épaulettes, et\\nqui par conséquent, avait tout à craindre.\\n\\n«Je courus chez notre aubergiste. Mes pressentiments ne m'avaient pas\\ntrompé: mon frère était arrivé la veille à Nîmes, et à la porte même de\\ncelui à qui il venait demander l'hospitalité, il avait été assassiné.\\n\\n«Je fis tout au monde pour connaître les meurtriers; mais personne\\nn'osa me dire leurs noms, tant ils étaient redoutés. Je songeai alors à\\ncette justice française, dont on m'avait tant parlé, qui ne redoute\\nrien, elle, et je me présentai chez le procureur du roi.\\n\\n--Et ce procureur du roi se nommait Villefort? demanda négligemment\\nMonte-Cristo.\\n\\n--Oui, Excellence: il venait de Marseille, où il avait été substitut.\\nSon zèle lui avait valu de l'avancement. Il était un des premiers,\\ndisait-on, qui eussent annoncé au gouvernement le débarquement de l'île\\nd'Elbe.\\n\\n--Donc, reprit Monte-Cristo, vous vous présentâtes chez lui.\\n\\n«--Monsieur, lui dis-je, mon frère a été assassiné hier dans les rues\\nde Nîmes, je ne sais point par qui, mais c'est votre mission de le\\nsavoir. Vous êtes ici chef de la justice, et c'est à la justice de\\nvenger ceux qu'elle n'a pas su défendre.\\n\\n«--Et qu'était votre frère? demanda le procureur du roi....\\n\\n«--Lieutenant au bataillon corse.\\n\\n«--Un soldat de l'usurpateur, alors?\\n\\n«--Un soldat des armées françaises.\\n\\n«--Eh bien, répliqua-t-il, il s'est servi et il a péri par l'épée.\\n\\n«--Vous vous trompez, monsieur; il a péri par le poignard.\\n\\n«--Que voulez-vous que j'y fasse? répondit le magistrat.\\n\\n«--Mais je vous l'ai dit: je veux que vous le vengiez.\\n\\n«--Et de qui?\\n\\n«--De ses assassins.\\n\\n«--Est-ce que je les connais, moi?\\n\\n«--Faites-les chercher.\\n\\n«--Pour quoi faire? Votre frère aura eu quelque querelle et se sera\\nbattu en duel. Tous ces anciens soldats se portent à des excès qui leur\\nréussissaient sous l'Empire, mais qui tournent mal pour eux maintenant;\\nor, nos gens du Midi n'aiment ni les soldats, ni les excès.\\n\\n«--Monsieur, repris-je, ce n'est pas pour moi que je vous prie. Moi, je\\npleurerai ou je me vengerai voilà tout; mais mon pauvre frère avait une\\nfemme. S'il m'arrivait malheur à mon tour, cette pauvre créature\\nmourrait de faim, car le travail seul de mon frère la faisait vivre.\\nObtenez pour elle une petite pension du gouvernement.\\n\\n«--Chaque révolution a ses catastrophes, répondit M. de Villefort;\\nvotre frère a été victime de celle-ci, c'est un malheur, et le\\ngouvernement ne doit rien à votre famille pour cela. Si nous avions à\\njuger toutes les vengeances que les partisans de l'usurpateur ont\\nexercées sur les partisans du roi quand à leur tour ils disposaient du\\npouvoir, votre frère serait peut-être aujourd'hui condamné à mort. Ce\\nqui s'accomplit est chose toute naturelle, car c'est la loi des\\nreprésailles.\\n\\n«--Eh quoi! monsieur, m'écriai-je, il est possible que vous me parliez\\nainsi, vous, un magistrat!...\\n\\n«--Tous ces Corses sont fous, ma parole d'honneur! répondit M. de\\nVillefort, et ils croient encore que leur compatriote est empereur. Vous\\nvous trompez de temps, mon cher; il fallait venir me dire cela il y a\\ndeux mois. Aujourd'hui il est trop tard; allez-vous-en donc, et si vous\\nne vous en allez pas, moi, je vais vous faire reconduire.\\n\\n«Je le regardai un instant pour voir si par une nouvelle supplication il\\ny avait quelque chose à espérer. Cet homme était de pierre. Je\\nm'approchai de lui:\\n\\n«--Eh bien, lui dis-je à demi-voix, puisque vous connaissez les Corses,\\nvous devez savoir comment ils tiennent leur parole. Vous trouvez qu'on a\\nbien fait de tuer mon frère qui était bonapartiste, parce que vous êtes\\nroyaliste, vous; eh bien, moi, qui suis bonapartiste aussi, je vous\\ndéclare une chose: c'est que je vous tuerai, vous. À partir de ce moment\\nje vous déclare la vendetta; ainsi, tenez-vous bien, et gardez-vous de\\nvotre mieux, car la première fois que nous nous trouverons face à face,\\nc'est que votre dernière heure sera venue.\\n\\n«Et là-dessus, avant qu'il fût revenu de sa surprise, j'ouvris la porte\\net je m'enfuis.\\n\\n--Ah! ah! dit Monte-Cristo, avec votre honnête figure, vous faites de\\nces choses-là, monsieur Bertuccio, et à un procureur du roi, encore! Fi\\ndonc! et savait-il au moins ce que cela voulait dire ce mot _vendetta_?\\n\\n--Il le savait si bien qu'à partir de ce moment il ne sortit plus seul\\net se calfeutra chez lui, me faisant chercher partout. Heureusement\\nj'étais si bien caché qu'il ne put me trouver. Alors la peur le prit,\\nil trembla de rester plus longtemps à Nîmes; il sollicita son changement\\nde résidence, et, comme c'était en effet un homme influent, il fut nommé\\nà Versailles; mais, vous le savez, il n'y a pas de distance pour un\\nCorse qui a juré de se venger de son ennemi, et sa voiture, si bien\\nmenée qu'elle fût, n'a jamais eu plus d'une demi-journée d'avance sur\\nmoi, qui cependant la suivis à pied.\\n\\n«L'important n'était pas de le tuer, cent fois j'en avais trouvé\\nl'occasion; mais il fallait le tuer sans être découvert et surtout sans\\nêtre arrêté. Désormais je ne m'appartenais plus: j'avais à protéger et à\\nnourrir ma belle-soeur. Pendant trois mois je guettai M. de Villefort;\\npendant trois mois il ne fit pas un pas, une démarche, une promenade,\\nque mon regard ne le suivît là où il allait. Enfin, je découvris qu'il\\nvenait mystérieusement à Auteuil: je le suivis encore et je le vis\\nentrer dans cette maison où nous sommes, seulement, au lieu d'entrer\\ncomme tout le monde par la grande porte de la rue, il venait soit à\\ncheval, soit en voiture, laissait voiture ou cheval à l'auberge, et\\nentrait par cette petite porte que vous voyez là.»\\n\\nMonte-Cristo fit de la tête un signe qui prouvait qu'au milieu de\\nl'obscurité il distinguait en effet l'entrée indiquée par Bertuccio.\\n\\n«Je n'avais plus besoin de rester à Versailles, je me fixai à Auteuil et\\nje m'informai. Si je voulais le prendre, c'était évidemment là qu'il me\\nfallait tendre mon piège.\\n\\n«La maison appartenait, comme le concierge l'a dit à Votre Excellence,\\nà M. de Saint-Méran, beau-père de Villefort. M. de Saint-Méran habitait\\nMarseille; par conséquent, cette campagne lui était inutile; aussi\\ndisait-on qu'il venait de la louer à une jeune veuve que l'on ne\\nconnaissait que sous le nom de la baronne.\\n\\n«En effet, un soir, en regardant par-dessus le mur, je vis une femme\\njeune et belle qui se promenait seule dans ce jardin, que nulle fenêtre\\nétrangère ne dominait; elle regardait fréquemment du côté de la petite\\nporte, et je compris que ce soir-là elle attendait M. de Villefort.\\nLorsqu'elle fut assez près de moi pour que malgré l'obscurité je pusse\\ndistinguer ses traits, je vis une belle jeune femme de dix-huit à\\ndix-neuf ans, grande et blonde. Comme elle était en simple peignoir et\\nque rien ne gênait sa taille, je pus remarquer qu'elle était enceinte\\net que sa grossesse même paraissait avancée.\\n\\n«Quelques moments après, on ouvrit la petite porte; un homme entra; la\\njeune femme courut le plus vite qu'elle put à sa rencontre, ils se\\njetèrent dans les bras l'un de l'autre, s'embrassèrent tendrement et\\nregagnèrent ensemble la maison.\\n\\n«Cet homme, c'était M. de Villefort. Je jugeai qu'en sortant, surtout\\ns'il sortait la nuit, il devait traverser seul le jardin dans toute sa\\nlongueur.\\n\\n--Et, demanda le comte, avez-vous su depuis le nom de cette femme?\\n\\n--Non, Excellence, répondit Bertuccio; vous allez voir que je n'eus pas\\nle temps de l'apprendre.\\n\\n--Continuez.\\n\\n--Ce soir-là, reprit Bertuccio, j'aurais pu tuer peut-être le procureur\\ndu roi; mais je ne connaissais pas encore assez le jardin dans tous ses\\ndétails. Je craignis de ne pas le tuer raide, et, si quelqu'un accourait\\nà ses cris, de ne pouvoir fuir. Je remis la partie au prochain\\nrendez-vous, et, pour que rien ne m'échappât, je pris une petite chambre\\ndonnant sur la rue que longeait le mur du jardin.\\n\\n«Trois jours après, vers sept heures du soir, je vis sortir de la maison\\nun domestique à cheval qui prit au galop le chemin qui conduisait à la\\nroute de Sèvres; je présumai qu'il allait à Versailles. Je ne me\\ntrompais pas. Trois heures après, l'homme revint tout couvert de\\npoussière; son message était terminé.\\n\\n«Dix minutes après, un autre homme à pied, enveloppé d'un manteau,\\nouvrit la petite porte du jardin, qui se referma sur lui.\\n\\n«Je descendis rapidement. Quoique je n'eusse pas vu le visage de\\nVillefort, je le reconnus au battement de mon coeur: je traversai la\\nrue, je gagnai une borne placée à l'angle du mur et à l'aide de laquelle\\nj'avais regardé une première fois dans le jardin.\\n\\n«Cette fois je ne me contentai pas de regarder, je tirai mon couteau de\\nma poche, je m'assurai que la pointe était bien affilée, et je sautai\\npar-dessus le mur.\\n\\n«Mon premier soin fut de courir à la porte; il avait laissé la clef en\\ndedans, en prenant la simple précaution de donner un double tour à la\\nserrure.\\n\\nRien n'entravait donc ma fuite de ce côté-là. Je me mis à étudier les\\nlocalités. Le jardin formait un carré long, une pelouse de fin gazon\\nanglais s'étendait au milieu, aux angles de cette pelouse étaient des\\nmassifs d'arbres au feuillage touffu et tout entremêlé de fleurs\\nd'automne.\\n\\n«Pour se rendre de la maison à la petite porte, ou de la petite porte à\\nla maison, soit qu'il entrât, soit qu'il sortît, M. de Villefort était\\nobligé de passer près d'un de ces massifs.\\n\\n«On était à la fin de septembre; le vent soufflait avec force; un peu de\\nlune pâle, et voilée à chaque instant par de gros nuages qui glissaient\\nrapidement au ciel, blanchissait le sable des allées qui conduisaient à\\nla maison, mais ne pouvait percer l'obscurité de ces massifs touffus\\ndans lesquels un homme pouvait demeurer caché sans qu'il y eût crainte\\nqu'on ne l'aperçût.\\n\\n«Je me cachai dans celui le plus près duquel devait passer Villefort; à\\npeine y étais-je, qu'au milieu des bouffées de vent qui courbaient les\\narbres au-dessus de mon front, je crus distinguer comme des\\ngémissements. Mais vous savez, ou plutôt vous ne savez pas, monsieur le\\ncomte, que celui qui attend le moment de commettre un assassinat croit\\ntoujours entendre pousser des cris sourds dans l'air. Deux heures\\ns'écoulèrent pendant lesquelles, à plusieurs reprises, je crus entendre\\nles mêmes gémissements. Minuit sonna.\\n\\n«Comme le dernier son vibrait encore lugubre et retentissant, j'aperçus\\nune lueur illuminant les fenêtres de l'escalier dérobé par lequel nous\\nsommes descendus tout à l'heure.\\n\\n«La porte s'ouvrit, et l'homme au manteau reparut. C'était le moment\\nterrible; mais depuis si longtemps je m'étais préparé à ce moment, que\\nrien en moi ne faiblit: je tirai mon couteau, je l'ouvris et je me tins\\nprêt.\\n\\n«L'homme au manteau vint droit à moi, mais à mesure qu'il avançait dans\\nl'espace découvert, je croyais remarquer qu'il tenait une arme de la\\nmain droite: j'eus peur, non pas d'une lutte, mais d'un insuccès.\\nLorsqu'il fut à quelques pas de moi seulement, je reconnus que ce que\\nj'avais pris pour une arme n'était rien autre chose qu'une bêche.\\n\\n«Je n'avais pas encore pu deviner dans quel but M. de Villefort tenait\\nune bêche à la main, lorsqu'il s'arrêta sur la lisière du massif, jeta\\nun regard autour de lui, et se mit à creuser un trou dans la terre. Ce\\nfut alors que je m'aperçus qu'il y avait quelque chose dans son manteau,\\nqu'il venait de déposer sur la pelouse pour être plus libre de ses\\nmouvements.\\n\\n«Alors, je l'avoue, un peu de curiosité se glissa dans ma haine: je\\nvoulus voir ce que venait faire là Villefort; je restai immobile, sans\\nhaleine, j'attendis.\\n\\n«Puis une idée m'était venue, qui se confirma en voyant le procureur du\\nroi tirer de son manteau un petit coffre long de deux pieds et large de\\nsix à huit pouces.\\n\\n«Je le laissai déposer le coffre dans le trou, sur lequel il repoussa la\\nterre; puis, sur cette terre fraîche, il appuya ses pieds pour faire\\ndisparaître la trace de l'oeuvre nocturne. Je m'élançai alors sur lui et\\nje lui enfonçai mon couteau dans la poitrine en lui disant:\\n\\n«--Je suis Giovanni Bertuccio! ta mort pour mon frère, ton trésor pour\\nsa veuve: tu vois bien que ma vengeance est plus complète que je ne\\nl'espérais.\\n\\n«Je ne sais s'il entendit ces paroles; je ne le crois pas, car il tomba\\nsans pousser un cri; je sentis les flots de son sang rejaillir brûlants\\nsur mes mains et sur mon visage; mais j'étais ivre, j'étais en délire;\\nce sang me rafraîchissait au lieu de me brûler. En une seconde, j'eus\\ndéterré le coffret à l'aide de la bêche; puis, pour qu'on ne vît pas que\\nje l'avais enlevé, je comblai à mon tour le trou, je jetai la bêche\\npar-dessus le mur, je m'élançai par la porte, que je fermai à double\\ntour en dehors et dont j'emportai la clef.\\n\\n--Bon! dit Monte-Cristo, c'était, à ce que je vois, un petit assassinat\\ndoublé de vol.\\n\\n--Non, Excellence, répondit Bertuccio, c'était une vendetta suivie de\\nrestitution.\\n\\n--Et la somme était ronde, au moins?\\n\\n--Ce n'était pas de l'argent.\\n\\n--Ah! oui, je me rappelle, dit Monte-Cristo n'avez-vous pas parlé d'un\\nenfant?\\n\\n--Justement, Excellence. Je courus jusqu'à la rivière, je m'assis sur le\\ntalus, et, pressé de savoir ce que contenait le coffre, je fis sauter la\\nserrure avec mon couteau.\\n\\n«Dans un lange de fine batiste était enveloppé un enfant qui venait de\\nnaître; son visage empourpré, ses mains violettes annonçaient qu'il\\navait dû succomber à une asphyxie causée par des ligaments naturels\\nroulés autour de son cou; cependant, comme il n'était pas froid encore,\\nj'hésitai à le jeter dans cette eau qui coulait à mes pieds. En effet,\\nau bout d'un instant je crus sentir un léger battement vers la région du\\ncoeur; je dégageai son cou du cordon qui l'enveloppait, et, comme\\nj'avais été infirmier à l'hôpital de Bastia, je fis ce qu'aurait pu\\nfaire un médecin en pareille circonstance, c'est-à-dire que je lui\\ninsufflai courageusement de l'air dans les poumons, qu'après un quart\\nd'heure d'efforts inouïs je le vis respirer, et j'entendis un cri\\ns'échapper de sa poitrine.\\n\\n«À mon tour, je jetai un cri, mais un cri de joie. Dieu ne me maudit\\ndonc pas, me dis-je, puisqu'il permet que je rende la vie à une créature\\nhumaine en échange de la vie que j'ai ôtée à une autre!\\n\\n--Et que fîtes-vous donc de cet enfant? demanda Monte-Cristo; c'était un\\nbagage assez embarrassant pour un homme qui avait besoin de fuir.\\n\\n--Aussi n'eus-je point un instant l'idée de le garder. Mais je savais\\nqu'il existait à Paris un hospice où on reçoit ces pauvres créatures. En\\npassant à la barrière, je déclarai avoir trouvé cet enfant sur la route\\net je m'informai. Le coffre était là qui faisait foi; les langes de\\nbatiste indiquaient que l'enfant appartenait à des parents riches; le\\nsang dont j'étais couvert pouvait aussi bien appartenir à l'enfant qu'à\\ntout autre individu. On ne me fit aucune objection; on m'indiqua\\nl'hospice, qui était situé tout au bout de la rue d'Enfer, et, après\\navoir pris la précaution de couper le lange en deux, de manière qu'une\\ndes deux lettres qui le marquaient continuât d'envelopper le corps de\\nl'enfant, je déposai mon fardeau dans le tour, je sonnai et je m'enfuis\\nà toutes jambes. Quinze jours après, j'étais de retour à Rogliano, et je\\ndisais à Assunta:\\n\\n«--Console-toi, ma soeur; Israël est mort, mais je l'ai vengé.\\n\\n«Alors elle me demanda l'explication de ces paroles, et je lui racontai\\ntout ce qui s'était passé.\\n\\n«--Giovanni, me dit Assunta, tu aurais dû rapporter cet enfant, nous lui\\neussions tenu lieu des parents qu'il a perdus, nous l'eussions appelé\\nBenedetto, et en faveur de cette bonne action Dieu nous eût bénis\\neffectivement.\\n\\n«Pour toute réponse je lui donnai la moitié de lange que j'avais\\nconservée, afin de faire réclamer l'enfant si nous étions plus riches.\\n\\n--Et de quelles lettres était marqué ce lange? demanda Monte-Cristo.\\n\\n--D'un H et d'un N surmontés d'un tortil de baron.\\n\\n--Je crois, Dieu me pardonne! que vous vous servez de termes de blason,\\nmonsieur Bertuccio! Où diable avez-vous fait vos études héraldiques?\\n\\n--À votre service, monsieur le comte, où l'on apprend toutes choses.\\n\\n--Continuez, je suis curieux de savoir deux choses.\\n\\n--Lesquelles, monseigneur?\\n\\n--Ce que devint ce petit garçon; ne m'avez-vous pas dit que c'était un\\npetit garçon, monsieur Bertuccio?\\n\\n--Non, Excellence; je ne me rappelle pas avoir parlé de cela.\\n\\n--Ah! je croyais avoir entendu, je me serai trompé.\\n\\n--Non, vous ne vous êtes pas trompé, car c'était effectivement un petit\\ngarçon; mais Votre Excellence désirait, disait-elle, savoir deux choses:\\nquelle est la seconde?\\n\\n--La seconde était le crime dont vous étiez accusé quand vous demandâtes\\nun confesseur, et que l'abbé Busoni alla vous trouver sur cette demande\\ndans la prison de Nîmes.\\n\\n--Peut-être ce récit sera-t-il bien long, Excellence.\\n\\n--Qu'importe? il est dix heures à peine, vous savez que je ne dors pas,\\net je suppose que de votre côté vous n'avez pas grande envie de dormir.»\\n\\n\\nBertuccio s'inclina et reprit sa narration.\\n\\n«Moitié pour chasser les souvenirs qui m'assiégeaient, moitié pour\\nsubvenir aux besoins de la pauvre veuve, je me remis avec ardeur à ce\\nmétier de contrebandier, devenu plus facile par le relâchement des lois\\nqui suit toujours les révolutions. Les côtes du Midi, surtout, étaient\\nmal gardées, à cause des émeutes éternelles qui avaient lieu, tantôt à\\nAvignon, tantôt à Nîmes, tantôt à Uzès. Nous profitâmes de cette espèce\\nde trêve qui nous était accordée par le gouvernement pour lier des\\nrelations avec tout le littoral. Depuis l'assassinat de mon frère dans\\nles rues de Nîmes, je n'avais pas voulu rentrer dans cette ville. Il en\\nrésulta que l'aubergiste avec lequel nous faisions des affaires, voyant\\nque nous ne voulions plus venir à lui, était venu à nous et avait fondé\\nune succursale de son auberge sur la route de Bellegarde à Beaucaire, à\\nl'enseigne du _Pont du Gard_. Nous avions ainsi, soit du côté\\nd'Aigues-Mortes, soit aux Martigues, soit à Bouc, une douzaine\\nd'entrepôts où nous déposions nos marchandises et où, au besoin, nous\\ntrouvions un refuge contre les douaniers et les gendarmes. C'est un\\nmétier qui rapporte beaucoup que celui de contrebandier, lorsqu'on y\\napplique une certaine intelligence secondée par quelque vigueur; quant à\\nmoi, je vivais dans les montagnes ayant maintenant une double raison de\\ncraindre gendarmes et douaniers, attendu que toute comparution devant\\nles juges pouvait amener une enquête, que cette enquête est toujours une\\nexcursion dans le passé, et que dans mon passé, à moi, on pouvait\\nrencontrer maintenant quelque chose plus grave que des cigares entrés en\\ncontrebande ou des barils d'eau-de-vie circulant sans laissez-passer.\\nAussi, préférant mille fois la mort à une arrestation, j'accomplissais\\ndes choses étonnantes, et qui, plus d'une fois, me donnèrent cette\\npreuve, que le trop grand soin que nous prenons de notre corps est à peu\\nprès le seul obstacle à la réussite de ceux de nos projets qui ont\\nbesoin d'une décision rapide et d'une exécution vigoureuse et\\ndéterminée. En effet une fois qu'on a fait le sacrifice de sa vie, on\\nn'est plus l'égal des autres hommes, ou plutôt les autres hommes ne sont\\nplus vos égaux, et quiconque a pris cette résolution sent, à l'instant\\nmême, décupler ses forces et s'agrandir son horizon.\\n\\n--De la philosophie, monsieur Bertuccio! interrompit le comte; mais vous\\navez donc fait un peu de tout dans votre vie?\\n\\n--Oh! pardon, Excellence!\\n\\n--Non! non! c'est que la philosophie à dix heures et demie du soir,\\nc'est un peu tard. Mais je n'ai pas d'autre observation à faire, attendu\\nque je la trouve exacte, ce qu'on ne peut pas dire de toutes les\\nphilosophies.\\n\\n--Mes courses devinrent donc de plus en plus étendues, de plus en plus\\nfructueuses. Assunta était ménagère, et notre petite fortune\\ns'arrondissait. Un jour que je partais pour une course:\\n\\n«--Va, dit-elle, et à ton retour je te ménage une surprise.\\n\\n«Je l'interrogeais inutilement: elle ne voulut rien me dire et je\\npartis.\\n\\n«La course dura près de six semaines; nous avions été à Lucques charger\\nde l'huile, et à Livourne prendre des cotons anglais; notre débarquement\\nse fit sans événement contraire, nous réalisâmes nos bénéfices et nous\\nrevînmes tout joyeux.\\n\\n«En rentrant dans la maison, la première chose que je vis à l'endroit le\\nplus apparent de la chambre d'Assunta dans un berceau somptueux\\nrelativement au reste de l'appartement, fut un enfant de sept à huit\\nmois. Je jetai un cri de joie. Les seuls moments de tristesse que\\nj'eusse éprouvés depuis l'assassinat du procureur du roi m'avaient été\\ncausés par l'abandon de cet enfant. Il va sans dire que de remords de\\nl'assassinat lui-même je n'en avais point eu.\\n\\n«La pauvre Assunta avait tout deviné: elle avait profité de mon\\nabsence, et, munie de la moitié du lange, ayant inscrit, pour ne point\\nl'oublier, le jour et l'heure précis où l'enfant avait été déposé à\\nl'hospice, elle était partie pour Paris et avait été elle-même le\\nréclamer. Aucune objection ne lui avait été faite, et l'enfant lui avait\\nété remis.\\n\\n«Ah! j'avoue, monsieur le comte, qu'en voyant cette pauvre créature\\ndormant dans son berceau, ma poitrine se gonfla, et que des larmes\\nsortirent de mes yeux.\\n\\n«--En vérité, Assunta, m'écriai-je, tu es une digne femme, et la\\nProvidence te bénira.\\n\\n--Ceci, dit Monte-Cristo, est moins exact que votre philosophie; il est\\nvrai que ce n'est que la foi.\\n\\n--Hélas! Excellence, reprit Bertuccio, vous avez bien raison, et ce fut\\ncet enfant lui-même que Dieu chargea de ma punition. Jamais nature plus\\nperverse ne se déclara plus prématurément, et cependant on ne dira pas\\nqu'il fut mal élevé, car ma soeur le traitait comme le fils d'un prince;\\nc'était un garçon d'une figure charmante, avec des yeux d'un bleu clair\\ncomme ces tons de faïences chinoises qui s'harmonisent si bien avec le\\nblanc laiteux du ton général; seulement ses cheveux d'un blond trop vif\\ndonnaient à sa figure un caractère étrange, qui doublait la vivacité de\\nson regard et la malice de son sourire. Malheureusement il y a un\\nproverbe qui dit que le roux est tout bon ou tout mauvais; le proverbe\\nne mentit pas pour Benedetto, et dès sa jeunesse il se montra tout\\nmauvais. Il est vrai aussi que la douceur de sa mère encouragea ses\\npremiers penchants; l'enfant, pour qui ma pauvre soeur allait au marché\\nde la ville, située à quatre ou cinq lieues de là, acheter les premiers\\nfruits et les sucreries les plus délicates, préférait aux oranges de\\nPalma et aux conserves de Gênes les châtaignes volées au voisin en\\nfranchissant les haies, ou les pommes séchées dans son grenier, tandis\\nqu'il avait à sa disposition les châtaignes et les pommes de notre\\nverger.\\n\\n«Un jour, Benedetto pouvait avoir cinq ou six ans, le voisin Wasilio,\\nqui, selon les habitudes de notre pays, n'enfermait ni sa bourse ni ses\\nbijoux, car, monsieur le comte le sait aussi bien que personne, en Corse\\nil n'y a pas de voleurs, le voisin Wasilio se plaignit à nous qu'un\\nlouis avait disparu de sa bourse; on crut qu'il avait mal compté, mais\\nlui prétendait être sûr de son fait. Ce jour-là Benedetto avait quitté\\nla maison dès le matin, et c'était une grande inquiétude chez nous,\\nlorsque le soir nous le vîmes revenir traînant un singe qu'il avait\\ntrouvé, disait-il, tout enchaîné au pied d'un arbre.\\n\\n«Depuis un mois la passion du méchant enfant, qui ne savait quelle chose\\ns'imaginer, était d'avoir un singe. Un bateleur qui était passé à\\nRogliano, et qui avait plusieurs de ces animaux dont les exercices\\nl'avaient fort réjoui, lui avait inspiré sans doute cette malheureuse\\nfantaisie.\\n\\n«--On ne trouve pas de singe dans nos bois, lui dis-je, et surtout de\\nsinge enchaîné; avoue-moi donc comment tu t'es procuré celui-ci.\\n\\n«Benedetto soutint son mensonge, et l'accompagna de détails qui\\nfaisaient plus d'honneur à son imagination qu'à sa véracité; je\\nm'irritai, il se mit à rire; je le menaçai, il fit deux pas en arrière.\\n\\n«--Tu ne peux pas me battre, dit-il, tu n'en as pas le droit, tu n'es\\npas mon père.\\n\\n«Nous ignorâmes toujours qui lui avait révélé ce fatal secret, que nous\\nlui avions caché cependant avec tant de soin; quoi qu'il en soit, cette\\nréponse, dans laquelle l'enfant se révéla tout entier, m'épouvanta\\npresque, mon bras levé retomba effectivement sans toucher le coupable;\\nl'enfant triompha, et cette victoire lui donna une telle audace qu'à\\npartir de ce moment tout l'argent d'Assunta, dont l'amour semblait\\naugmenter pour lui à mesure qu'il en était moins digne, passa en\\ncaprices qu'elle ne savait pas combattre, en folies qu'elle n'avait pas\\nle courage d'empêcher. Quand j'étais à Rogliano, les choses marchaient\\nencore assez convenablement; mais dès que j'étais parti, c'était\\nBenedetto qui était devenu le maître de la maison, et tout tournait à\\nmal. Âgé de onze ans à peine, tous ses camarades étaient choisis parmi\\ndes jeunes gens de dix-huit ou vingt ans, les plus mauvais sujets de\\nBastia et de Corte, et déjà, pour quelques espiègleries qui méritaient\\nun nom plus sérieux, la justice nous avait donné des avertissements.\\n\\n«Je fus effrayé; toute information pouvait avoir des suites funestes:\\nj'allais justement être forcé de m'éloigner de la Corse pour une\\nexpédition importante. Je réfléchis longtemps, et, dans le pressentiment\\nd'éviter quelque malheur, je me décidai à emmener Benedetto avec moi.\\nJ'espérais que la vie active et rude de contrebandier, la discipline\\nsévère du bord, changeraient ce caractère prêt à se corrompre, s'il\\nn'était pas déjà affreusement corrompu.\\n\\n«Je tirai donc Benedetto à part et lui fis la proposition de me suivre,\\nen entourant cette proposition de toutes les promesses qui peuvent\\nséduire un enfant de douze ans.\\n\\n«Il me laissa aller jusqu'au bout, et lorsque j'eus finis, éclatant de\\nrire:\\n\\n«--Êtes-vous fou, mon oncle? dit-il (il m'appelait ainsi quand il était\\nde belle humeur); moi changer la vie que je mène contre celle que vous\\nmenez, ma bonne et excellente paresse contre l'horrible travail que vous\\nvous êtes imposé! passer la nuit au froid, le jour au chaud; se cacher\\nsans cesse; quand on se montre recevoir des coups de fusil, et tout cela\\npour gagner un peu d'argent! L'argent, j'en ai tant que j'en veux! mère\\nAssunta m'en donne quand je lui en demande. Vous voyez donc bien que je\\nserais un imbécile si j'acceptais ce que vous me proposez.\\n\\n«J'étais stupéfait de cette audace et de ce raisonnement. Benedetto\\nretourna jouer avec ses camarades, et je le vis de loin me montrant à\\neux comme un idiot.\\n\\n--Charmant enfant! murmura Monte-Cristo.\\n\\n--Oh! s'il eût été à moi, répondit Bertuccio, s'il eût été mon fils, ou\\ntout au moins mon neveu, je l'eusse bien ramené au droit sentier, car la\\nconscience donne la force. Mais l'idée que j'allais battre un enfant\\ndont j'avais tué le père me rendait toute correction impossible. Je\\ndonnai de bons conseils à ma soeur, qui, dans nos discussions, prenait\\nsans cesse la défense du petit malheureux, et comme elle m'avoua que\\nplusieurs fois des sommes assez considérables lui avaient manqué, je lui\\nindiquai un endroit où elle pouvait cacher notre petit trésor. Quant à\\nmoi, ma résolution était prise. Benedetto savait parfaitement lire,\\nécrire et compter, car lorsqu'il voulait s'adonner par hasard au\\ntravail, il apprenait en un jour ce que les autres apprenaient en une\\nsemaine. Ma résolution, dis-je, était prise; je devais l'engager comme\\nsecrétaire sur quelque navire au long cours, et, sans le prévenir de\\nrien, le faire prendre un beau matin et le faire transporter à bord; de\\ncette façon, et en le recommandant au capitaine, tout son avenir\\ndépendait de lui. Ce plan arrêté, je partis pour la France.\\n\\n«Toutes nos opérations devaient cette fois s'exécuter dans le golfe du\\nLion, et ces opérations devenaient de plus en plus difficiles, car nous\\nétions en 1829. La tranquillité était parfaitement rétablie, et par\\nconséquent le service des côtes était redevenu plus régulier et plus\\nsévère que jamais. Cette surveillance était encore augmentée\\nmomentanément par la foire de Beaucaire, qui venait de s'ouvrir.\\n\\n«Les commencements de notre expédition s'exécutèrent sans encombre.\\nNous amarrâmes notre barque, qui avait un double fond dans lequel nous\\ncachions nos marchandises de contrebande, au milieu d'une quantité de\\nbateaux qui bordaient les deux rives du Rhône, depuis Beaucaire jusqu'à\\nArles. Arrivés là, nous commençâmes à décharger nuitamment nos\\nmarchandises prohibées, et à les faire passer dans la ville par\\nl'intermédiaire des gens qui étaient en relations avec nous, ou des\\naubergistes chez lesquels nous faisions des dépôts. Soit que la réussite\\nnous eût rendus imprudents, soit que nous ayons été trahis, un soir,\\nvers les cinq heures de l'après-midi, comme nous allions nous mettre à\\ngoûter, notre petit mousse accourut tout effaré en disant qu'il avait vu\\nune escouade de douaniers se diriger de notre côté. Ce n'était pas\\nprécisément l'escouade qui nous effrayait: à chaque instant, surtout\\ndans ce moment-là, des compagnies entières rôdaient sur les bords du\\nRhône; mais c'étaient les précautions qu'au dire de l'enfant cette\\nescouade prenait pour ne pas être vue. En un instant nous fûmes sur\\npied, mais il était déjà trop tard; notre barque, évidemment l'objet des\\nrecherches, était entourée. Parmi les douaniers, je remarquai quelques\\ngendarmes; et, aussi timide à la vue de ceux-ci que j'étais brave\\nordinairement à la vue de tout autre corps militaire, je descendis dans\\nla cale, et, me glissant par un sabord, je me laissai couler dans le\\nfleuve, puis je nageai entre deux eaux, ne respirant qu'à de longs\\nintervalles, si bien que je gagnai sans être vu une tranchée que l'on\\nvenait de faire, et qui communiquait du Rhône au canal qui se rend de\\nBeaucaire à Aigues-Mortes. Une fois arrivé là, j'étais sauvé, car je\\npouvais suivre sans être vu cette tranchée. Je gagnai donc le canal sans\\naccident. Ce n'était pas par hasard et sans préméditation que j'avais\\nsuivi ce chemin; j'ai déjà parlé à Votre Excellence d'un aubergiste de\\nNîmes qui avait établi sur la route de Bellegarde à Beaucaire une petite\\nhôtellerie.\\n\\n--Oui, dit Monte-Cristo, je me souviens parfaitement. Ce digne homme, si\\nje ne me trompe, était même votre associé.\\n\\n--C'est cela, répondit Bertuccio; mais depuis sept ou huit ans, il avait\\ncédé son établissement à un ancien tailleur de Marseille qui, après\\ns'être ruiné dans son état, avait voulu essayer de faire sa fortune dans\\nun autre. Il va sans dire que les petits arrangements que nous avions\\nfaits avec le premier propriétaire furent maintenus avec le second;\\nc'était donc à cet homme que je comptais demander asile.\\n\\n--Et comment se nommait cet homme? demanda le comte, qui paraissait\\ncommencer à reprendre quelque intérêt au récit de Bertuccio.\\n\\n--Il s'appelait Gaspard Caderousse, il était marié à une femme du\\nvillage de la Carconte, et que nous ne connaissions pas sous un autre\\nnom que celui de son village; c'était une pauvre femme atteinte de la\\nfièvre des marais, qui s'en allait mourant de langueur. Quant à l'homme,\\nc'était un robuste gaillard de quarante à quarante-cinq ans, qui plus\\nd'une fois nous avait, dans des circonstances difficiles, donné des\\npreuves de sa présence d'esprit et de son courage.\\n\\n--Et vous dites, demanda Monte-Cristo, que ces choses se passaient vers\\nl'année....\\n\\n--1829, monsieur le comte.\\n\\n--En quel mois?\\n\\n--Au mois de juin.\\n\\n--Au commencement ou à la fin.\\n\\n--C'était le 3 au soir.\\n\\n--Ah! fit Monte-Cristo, le 3 juin 1829... Bien, continuez.\\n\\n--C'était donc à Caderousse que je comptais demander asile; mais, comme\\nd'habitude, et même dans les circonstances ordinaires, nous n'entrions\\npas chez lui par la porte qui donnait sur la route, je résolus de ne pas\\ndéroger à cette coutume, j'enjambai la haie du jardin, je me glissai en\\nrampant à travers les oliviers rabougris et les figuiers sauvages, et je\\ngagnai, dans la crainte que Caderousse n'eût quelque voyageur dans son\\nauberge, une espèce de soupente dans laquelle plus d'une fois j'avais\\npassé la nuit aussi bien que dans le meilleur lit. Cette soupente\\nn'était séparée de la salle commune du rez-de-chaussée de l'auberge que\\npar une cloison en planches dans laquelle des jours avaient été ménagés\\nà notre intention, afin que de là nous pussions guetter le moment\\nopportun de faire reconnaître que nous étions dans le voisinage. Je\\ncomptais, si Caderousse était seul, le prévenir de mon arrivée, achever\\nchez lui le repas interrompu par l'apparition des douaniers, et\\nprofiter de l'orage qui se préparait pour regagner les bords du Rhône et\\nm'assurer de ce qu'étaient devenus la barque et ceux qui la montaient.\\nJe me glissai donc dans la soupente et bien m'en prit, car à ce moment\\nmême Caderousse rentrait chez lui avec un inconnu.\\n\\n«Je me tins coi et j'attendis, non point dans l'intention de surprendre\\nles secrets de mon hôte, mais parce que je ne pouvais faire autrement;\\nd'ailleurs, dix fois même chose était déjà arrivée.\\n\\n«L'homme qui accompagnait Caderousse était évidemment étranger au Midi\\nde la France: c'était un de ces négociants forains qui viennent vendre\\ndes bijoux à la foire de Beaucaire et qui, pendant un mois que dure\\ncette foire, où affluent des marchands et des acquéreurs de toutes les\\nparties de l'Europe, font quelquefois pour cent ou cent cinquante mille\\nfrancs d'affaires.\\n\\n«Caderousse entra vivement et le premier. Puis voyant la salle d'en bas\\nvide comme d'habitude et simplement gardée par son chien, il appela sa\\nfemme.\\n\\n«--Hé! la Carconte, dit-il, ce digne homme de prêtre ne nous avait pas\\ntrompés; le diamant était bon.\\n\\n«Une exclamation joyeuse se fit entendre, et presque aussitôt l'escalier\\ncraqua sous un pas alourdi par la faiblesse et la maladie.\\n\\n«--Qu'est-ce que tu dis? demanda la femme plus pâle qu'une morte.\\n\\n«--Je dis que le diamant était bon, que voilà monsieur, un des premiers\\nbijoutiers de Paris, qui est prêt à nous en donner cinquante mille\\nfrancs. Seulement, pour être sûr que le diamant est bien à nous, il\\ndemande que tu lui racontes, comme je l'ai déjà fait, de quelle façon\\nmiraculeuse le diamant est tombé entre nos mains. En attendant,\\nmonsieur, asseyez-vous, s'il vous plaît, et comme le temps est lourd, je\\nvais aller chercher de quoi vous rafraîchir.\\n\\n«Le bijoutier examinait avec attention l'intérieur de l'auberge et la\\npauvreté bien visible de ceux qui allaient lui vendre un diamant qui\\nsemblait sortir de l'écrin d'un prince.\\n\\n«--Racontez, madame, dit-il, voulant sans doute profiter de l'absence\\ndu mari pour qu'aucun signe de la part de celui-ci n'influençât la\\nfemme, et pour voir si les deux récits cadreraient bien l'un avec\\nl'autre.\\n\\n«--Eh! mon Dieu! dit la femme avec volubilité, c'est une bénédiction du\\nciel à laquelle nous étions loin de nous attendre. Imaginez-vous, mon\\ncher monsieur, que mon mari a été lié en 1814 ou 1815 avec un marin\\nnommé Edmond Dantès: ce pauvre garçon, que Caderousse avait complètement\\noublié ne l'a pas oublié, lui, et lui a laissé en mourant le diamant que\\nvous venez de voir.\\n\\n«--Mais comment était-il devenu possesseur de ce diamant? demanda le\\nbijoutier. Il l'avait donc avant d'entrer en prison?\\n\\n«--Non, monsieur, répondit la femme, mais en prison il a fait, à ce\\nqu'il paraît, la connaissance d'un Anglais très riche; et comme en\\nprison son compagnon de chambre est tombé malade, et que Dantès en prit\\nles mêmes soins que si c'était son frère, l'Anglais, en sortant de\\ncaptivité, laissa au pauvre Dantès, qui, moins heureux que lui, est mort\\nen prison, ce diamant qu'il nous a légué à son tour en mourant, et qu'il\\na chargé le digne abbé qui est venu ce matin de nous remettre.\\n\\n«--C'est bien la même chose, murmura le bijoutier, et, au bout du compte\\nl'histoire peut être vraie, tout invraisemblable qu'elle paraisse au\\npremier abord. Il n'y a donc que le prix sur lequel nous ne sommes pas\\nd'accord.\\n\\n«--Comment! pas d'accord, dit Caderousse; je croyais que vous aviez\\nconsenti au prix que j'en demandais.\\n\\n«--C'est-à-dire, reprit le bijoutier, que j'en ai offert quarante mille\\nfrancs.\\n\\n«--Quarante mille! s'écria la Carconte; nous ne le donnerons\\ncertainement pas pour ce prix-là. L'abbé nous a dit qu'il valait\\ncinquante mille francs, et sans la monture encore.\\n\\n«--Et comment se nommait cet abbé? demanda l'infatigable questionneur.\\n\\n«--L'abbé Busoni, répondit la femme.\\n\\n«--C'était donc un étranger?\\n\\n«--C'était un Italien des environs de Mantoue, je crois.\\n\\n«--Montrez-moi ce diamant, reprit le bijoutier, que je le revoie une\\nseconde fois; souvent on juge mal les pierres à une première vue.»\\n\\n«Caderousse tira de sa poche un petit étui de chagrin noir, l'ouvrit et\\nle passa au bijoutier. À la vue du diamant, qui était gros comme une\\npetite noisette, je me le rappelle comme si je le voyais encore, les\\nyeux de la Carconte étincelèrent de cupidité.\\n\\n--Et que pensiez-vous de tout cela, monsieur l'écouteur aux portes?\\ndemanda Monte-Cristo; ajoutiez-vous foi à cette belle fable?\\n\\n--Oui, Excellence; je ne regardais pas Caderousse comme un méchant\\nhomme, et je le croyais incapable d'avoir commis un crime ou même un\\nvol.\\n\\n--Cela fait plus honneur à votre coeur qu'à votre expérience, monsieur\\nBertuccio. Aviez-vous connu cet Edmond Dantès dont il était question?\\n\\n--Non, Excellence, je n'en avais jamais entendu parler jusqu'alors, et\\nje n'en ai jamais entendu reparler depuis qu'une seule fois par l'abbé\\nBusoni lui-même, quand je le vis dans les prisons de Nîmes.\\n\\n--Bien! continuez.\\n\\n--Le bijoutier prit la bague des mains de Caderousse, et tira de sa\\npoche une petite pince en acier et une petite paire de balances de\\ncuivre; puis, écartant les crampons d'or qui retenaient la pierre dans\\nla bague, il fit sortir le diamant de son alvéole, et le pesa\\nminutieusement dans les balances.\\n\\n«--J'irai jusqu'à quarante-cinq mille francs, dit-il, mais je ne\\ndonnerai pas un sou avec; d'ailleurs, comme c'était ce que valait le\\ndiamant, j'ai pris juste cette somme sur moi.\\n\\n«--Oh! qu'à cela ne tienne, dit Caderousse, je retournerai avec vous à\\nBeaucaire pour chercher les cinq autres mille francs.\\n\\n«--Non, dit le bijoutier en rendant l'anneau et le diamant à Caderousse;\\nnon, cela ne vaut pas davantage, et encore je suis fâché d'avoir offert\\ncette somme, attendu qu'il y a dans la pierre un défaut que je n'avais\\npas vu d'abord; mais n'importe, je n'ai qu'une parole, j'ai dit\\nquarante-cinq mille francs, je ne m'en dédis pas.\\n\\n«--Au moins remettez le diamant dans la bague», dit aigrement la\\nCarconte.\\n\\n«--C'est juste, dit le bijoutier.\\n\\n«Et il replaça la pierre dans le chaton.\\n\\n«--Bon, bon, bon, dit Caderousse remettant l'étui dans sa poche, on le\\nvendra à un autre.\\n\\n«--Oui, reprit le bijoutier, mais un autre ne sera pas si facile que\\nmoi; un autre ne se contentera pas des renseignements que vous m'avez\\ndonnés; il n'est pas naturel qu'un homme comme vous possède un diamant\\nde cinquante mille francs; il ira prévenir les magistrats, il faudra\\nretrouver l'abbé Busoni, et les abbés qui donnent des diamants de deux\\nmille louis sont rares; la justice commencera par mettre la main dessus,\\non vous enverra en prison, et si vous êtes reconnu innocent, qu'on vous\\nmette dehors après trois ou quatre mois de captivité, la bague se sera\\négarée au greffe, ou l'on vous donnera une pierre fausse qui vaudra\\ntrois francs au lieu d'un diamant qui en vaut cinquante mille,\\ncinquante-cinq mille peut-être, mais que, vous en conviendrez, mon brave\\nhomme, on court certains risques à acheter.»\\n\\n«Caderousse et sa femme s'interrogèrent du regard.\\n\\n«--Non, dit Caderousse, nous ne sommes pas assez riches pour perdre cinq\\nmille francs.\\n\\n«--Comme vous voudrez, mon cher ami, dit le bijoutier; j'avais\\ncependant, comme vous le voyez, apporté de la belle monnaie.\\n\\n«Et il tira d'une de ses poches une poignée d'or qu'il fit briller aux\\nyeux éblouis de l'aubergiste, et, de l'autre, un paquet de billets de\\nbanque.\\n\\n«Un rude combat se livrait visiblement dans l'esprit de Caderousse: il\\nétait évident que ce petit étui de chagrin qu'il tournait et retournait\\ndans sa main ne lui paraissait pas correspondre comme valeur à la somme\\nénorme qui fascinait ses yeux. Il se retourna vers sa femme.\\n\\n«--Qu'en dis-tu? lui demanda-t-il tout bas.\\n\\n«--Donne, donne, dit-elle; s'il retourne à Beaucaire sans le diamant, il\\nnous dénoncera! et, comme il le dit, qui sait si nous pourrons jamais\\nremettre la main sur l'abbé Busoni.\\n\\n«--Eh bien, soit, dit Caderousse, prenez donc le diamant pour\\nquarante-cinq mille francs; mais ma femme veut une chaîne d'or, et moi\\nune paire de boucles d'argent.\\n\\n«Le bijoutier tira de sa poche une boîte longue et plate qui contenait\\nplusieurs échantillons des objets demandés.\\n\\n«--Tenez, dit-il, je suis rond en affaires; choisissez.\\n\\n«La femme choisit une chaîne d'or qui pouvait valoir cinq louis, et le\\nmari une paire de boucles qui pouvait valoir quinze francs.\\n\\n«--J'espère que vous ne vous plaindrez pas, dit le bijoutier.\\n\\n«--L'abbé avait dit qu'il valait cinquante mille francs, murmura\\nCaderousse.\\n\\n«--Allons, allons, donnez donc! Quel homme terrible! reprit le bijoutier\\nen lui tirant des mains le diamant, je lui compte quarante-cinq mille\\nfrancs, deux mille cinq cents livres de rente, c'est-à-dire une fortune\\ncomme je voudrais bien en avoir une, moi, et il n'est pas encore\\ncontent.\\n\\n«--Et les quarante-cinq mille francs, demanda Caderousse d'une voix\\nrauque; voyons, où sont-ils?\\n\\n«--Les voilà, dit le bijoutier.\\n\\n«Et il compta sur la table quinze mille francs en or et trente mille\\nfrancs en billets de banque.\\n\\n«--Attendez que j'allume la lampe, dit la Carconte, il n'y fait plus\\nclair, et on pourrait se tromper.\\n\\n«En effet, la nuit était venue pendant cette discussion, et, avec la\\nnuit, l'orage qui menaçait depuis une demi-heure. On entendait gronder\\nsourdement le tonnerre dans le lointain; mais ni le bijoutier, ni\\nCaderousse, ni la Carconte, ne paraissaient s'en occuper, possédés\\nqu'ils étaient tous les trois du démon du gain. Moi-même, j'éprouvais\\nune étrange fascination à la vue de tout cet or et de tous ces billets.\\nIl me semblait que je faisais un rêve, et, comme il arrive dans un rêve,\\nje me sentais enchaîné à ma place.\\n\\n«Caderousse compta et recompta l'or et les billets, puis il les passa à\\nsa femme, qui les compta et recompta à son tour.\\n\\n«Pendant ce temps, le bijoutier faisait miroiter le diamant sous les\\nrayons de la lampe, et le diamant jetait des éclairs qui lui faisaient\\noublier ceux qui, précurseurs de l'orage, commençaient à enflammer les\\nfenêtres.\\n\\n«--Eh bien, le compte y est-il? demanda le bijoutier.\\n\\n«--Oui, dit Caderousse; donne le portefeuille et cherche un sac,\\nCarconte.\\n\\n«La Carconte alla à une armoire et revint apportant un vieux\\nportefeuille de cuir, duquel on tira quelques lettres graisseuses à la\\nplace desquelles on remit les billets, et un sac dans lequel étaient\\nenfermés deux ou trois écus de six livres, qui composaient probablement\\ntoute la fortune du misérable ménage.\\n\\n«--Là, dit Caderousse, quoique vous nous ayez soulevé une dizaine de\\nmille francs peut-être, voulez-vous souper avec nous? c'est de bon\\ncoeur.\\n\\n«--Merci, dit le bijoutier, il doit se faire tard, et il faut que je\\nretourne à Beaucaire; ma femme serait inquiète»; il tira sa montre.\\n«Morbleu! s'écria-t-il, neuf heures bientôt, je ne serai pas à Beaucaire\\navant minuit. Adieu, mes petits enfants; s'il vous revient par hasard\\ndes abbés Busoni, pensez à moi.\\n\\n«--Dans huit jours, vous ne serez plus à Beaucaire, dit Caderousse,\\npuisque la foire finit la semaine prochaine.\\n\\n«--Non, mais cela ne fait rien; écrivez-moi à Paris, à M. Joannès, au\\nPalais-Royal, galerie de Pierre, n° 45, je ferai le voyage exprès si\\ncela en vaut la peine.\\n\\n«Un coup de tonnerre retentit, accompagné d'un éclair si violent qu'il\\neffaça presque la clarté de la lampe.\\n\\n«--Oh! oh! dit Caderousse, vous allez partir par ce temps-là?\\n\\n«--Oh! je n'ai pas peur du tonnerre, dit le bijoutier.\\n\\n«--Et des voleurs? demanda la Carconte. La route n'est jamais bien sûre\\npendant la foire.\\n\\n«--Oh! quant aux voleurs, dit Joannès, voilà pour eux.\\n\\n«Et il tira de sa poche une paire de petits pistolets chargés jusqu'à la\\ngueule.\\n\\n«--Voilà, dit-il, des chiens qui aboient et mordent en même temps: c'est\\npour les deux premiers qui auraient envie de votre diamant, père\\nCaderousse.\\n\\n«Caderousse et sa femme échangèrent un regard sombre. Il paraît qu'ils\\navaient en même temps quelque terrible pensée.\\n\\n«--Alors, bon voyage! dit Caderousse.\\n\\n«--Merci!» dit le bijoutier.\\n\\n«Il prit sa canne qu'il avait posée contre un vieux bahut, et sortit. Au\\nmoment où il ouvrit la porte, une telle bouffée de vent entra qu'elle\\nfaillit éteindre la lampe.\\n\\n«--Oh! dit-il, il va faire un joli temps, et deux lieues de pays à faire\\navec ce temps-là!\\n\\n«--Restez, dit Caderousse, vous coucherez ici.\\n\\n«--Oui, restez, dit la Carconte d'une voix tremblante, nous aurons bien\\nsoin de vous.\\n\\n«--Non pas, il faut que j'aille coucher à Beaucaire. Adieu.»\\n\\n«Caderousse alla lentement jusqu'au seuil.\\n\\n«--Il ne fait ni ciel ni terre, dit le bijoutier déjà hors de la maison.\\nFaut-il prendre à droite ou à gauche?\\n\\n«--À droite, dit Caderousse; il n'y a pas à s'y tromper, la route est\\nbordée d'arbres de chaque côté.\\n\\n«--Bon, j'y suis, dit la voix presque perdue dans le lointain.\\n\\n«--Ferme donc la porte, dit la Carconte, je n'aime pas les portes\\nouvertes quand il tonne.\\n\\n«--Et quand il y a de l'argent dans la maison, n'est-ce pas?» dit\\nCaderousse en donnant un double tour à la serrure.\\n\\n«Il rentra, alla à l'armoire, retira le sac et le portefeuille, et tous\\ndeux se mirent à recompter pour la troisième fois leur or et leurs\\nbillets. Je n'ai jamais vu expression pareille à ces deux visages dont\\ncette maigre lampe éclairait la cupidité. La femme surtout était\\nhideuse; le tremblement fiévreux qui l'animait habituellement avait\\nredoublé. Son visage de pâle était devenu livide; ses yeux caves\\nflamboyaient.\\n\\n«--Pourquoi donc, demanda-t-elle d'une voix sourde, lui avais-tu offert\\nde coucher ici?\\n\\n«--Mais, répondit Caderousse en tressaillant, pour... pour qu'il n'eût\\npas la peine de retourner à Beaucaire.\\n\\n«--Ah! dit la femme avec une expression impossible à rendre, je croyais\\nque c'était pour autre chose, moi.\\n\\n«--Femme! femme! s'écria Caderousse, pourquoi as-tu de pareilles idées,\\net pourquoi les ayant ne les gardes-tu pas pour toi?\\n\\n«--C'est égal, dit la Carconte après un instant de silence, tu n'es pas\\nun homme.\\n\\n«--Comment cela? fit Caderousse.\\n\\n«--Si tu avais été un homme, il ne serait pas sorti.\\n\\n«--Femme!\\n\\n«--Ou bien il n'arriverait pas à Beaucaire.\\n\\n«--Femme!\\n\\n«--La route fait un coude et il est obligé de suivre la route, tandis\\nqu'il y a le long du canal un chemin qui raccourcit.\\n\\n«--Femme, tu offenses le Bon Dieu. Tiens, écoute....\\n\\n«En effet, on entendit un effroyable coup de tonnerre en même temps\\nqu'un éclair bleuâtre enflammait toute la salle, et la foudre,\\ndécroissant lentement, sembla s'éloigner comme à regret de la maison\\nmaudite.\\n\\n«--Jésus! dit la Carconte en se signant.\\n\\n«Au même instant, et au milieu de ce silence de terreur qui suit\\nordinairement les coups de tonnerre, on entendit frapper à la porte.\\n\\n«Caderousse et sa femme tressaillirent et se regardèrent épouvantés.\\n\\n«--Qui va là? s'écria Caderousse en se levant et en réunissant en un\\nseul tas l'or et les billets épars sur la table et qu'il couvrit de ses\\ndeux mains.\\n\\n«--Moi! dit une voix.\\n\\n«--Qui, vous?\\n\\n«--Et pardieu! Joannès le bijoutier.\\n\\n«--Eh bien, que disais-tu donc, reprit la Carconte avec un effroyable\\nsourire, que j'offensais le Bon Dieu!... Voilà le Bon Dieu qui nous le\\nrenvoie.\\n\\n«Caderousse retomba pâle et haletant sur sa chaise. La Carconte, au\\ncontraire, se leva, et alla d'un pas ferme à la porte qu'elle ouvrit.\\n\\n«--Entrez donc, cher monsieur Joannès, dit-elle.\\n\\n«--Ma foi, dit le bijoutier ruisselant de pluie, il paraît que le diable\\nne veut pas que je retourne à Beaucaire ce soir. Les plus courtes folies\\nsont les meilleures, mon cher monsieur Caderousse; vous m'avez offert\\nl'hospitalité, je l'accepte et je reviens coucher chez vous.»\\n\\nCaderousse balbutia quelques mots en essuyant la sueur qui coulait sur\\nson front. La Carconte referma la porte à double tour derrière le\\nbijoutier.\",\n",
       " 'XLV': \"«En entrant, le bijoutier jeta un regard interrogateur autour de lui;\\nmais rien ne semblait faire naître les soupçons s'il n'en avait pas,\\nrien ne semblait les confirmer s'il en avait.\\n\\n«Caderousse tenait toujours des deux mains ses billets et son or. La\\nCarconte souriait à son hôte le plus agréablement qu'elle pouvait.\\n\\n«--Ah! ah! dit le bijoutier, il paraît que vous aviez peur de ne pas\\navoir votre compte, que vous repassiez votre trésor après mon départ.\\n\\n«--Non pas, dit Caderousse; mais l'événement qui nous en fait possesseur\\nest si inattendu que nous n'y pouvons croire, et que, lorsque nous\\nn'avons pas la preuve matérielle sous les yeux, nous croyons faire\\nencore un rêve.»\\n\\n«Le bijoutier sourit.\\n\\n«--Est-ce que vous avez des voyageurs dans votre auberge? demanda-t-il.\\n\\n«--Non, répondit Caderousse, nous ne donnons point à coucher; nous\\nsommes trop près de la ville, et personne ne s'arrête.\\n\\n«--Alors, je vais vous gêner horriblement?\\n\\n«--Nous gêner, vous! mon cher monsieur! dit gracieusement la Carconte,\\npas du tout, je vous jure.\\n\\n«--Voyons, où me mettez-vous?\\n\\n«--Dans la chambre là-haut.\\n\\n«--Mais n'est-ce pas votre chambre?\\n\\n«--Oh! n'importe; nous avons un second lit dans la pièce à côté de\\ncelle-ci.\\n\\n«Caderousse regarda avec étonnement sa femme. Le bijoutier chantonna un\\npetit air en se chauffant le dos à un fagot que la Carconte venait\\nd'allumer dans la cheminée pour sécher son hôte.\\n\\n«Pendant ce temps, elle apportait sur un coin de la table où elle avait\\nétendu une serviette les maigres restes d'un dîner, auxquels elle\\njoignit deux ou trois oeufs frais.\\n\\n«Caderousse avait renfermé de nouveau les billets dans son portefeuille,\\nson or dans un sac, et le tout dans son armoire. Il se promenait de long\\nen large, sombre et pensif, levant de temps en temps la tête sur le\\nbijoutier, qui se tenait tout fumant devant l'âtre, et qui, à mesure\\nqu'il se séchait d'un côté, se tournait de l'autre.\\n\\n«--Là, dit la Carconte en posant une bouteille de vin sur la table,\\nquand vous voudrez souper tout est prêt.\\n\\n«--Et vous? demanda Joannès.\\n\\n«--Moi, je ne souperai pas, répondit Caderousse.\\n\\n«--Nous avons dîné très tard, se hâta de dire la Carconte.\\n\\n«--Je vais donc souper seul? fit le bijoutier.\\n\\n«--Nous vous servirons, répondit la Carconte avec un empressement qui\\nne lui était pas habituel, même envers ses hôtes payants.\\n\\n«De temps en temps Caderousse lançait sur elle un regard rapide comme un\\néclair.\\n\\n«L'orage continuait.\\n\\n«--Entendez-vous, entendez-vous? dit la Carconte; vous avez, ma foi,\\nbien fait de revenir.\\n\\n«--Ce qui n'empêche pas, dit le bijoutier, que si, pendant mon souper,\\nl'ouragan s'apaise, je me remettrai en route.\\n\\n«--C'est le mistral, dit Caderousse en secouant la tête; nous en avons\\npour jusqu'à demain.\\n\\n«Et il poussa un soupir.\\n\\n«--Ma foi, dit le bijoutier en se mettant à table, tant pis pour ceux\\nqui sont dehors.\\n\\n«--Oui, reprit la Carconte, ils passeront une mauvaise nuit.\\n\\n«Le bijoutier commença de souper, et la Carconte continua d'avoir pour\\nlui tous les petits soins d'une hôtesse attentive; elle d'ordinaire si\\nquinteuse et si revêche, elle était devenue un modèle de prévenance et\\nde politesse. Si le bijoutier l'eût connue auparavant, un si grand\\nchangement l'eût certes étonné et n'eût pas manqué de lui inspirer\\nquelque soupçon. Quant à Caderousse, il ne disait pas une parole,\\ncontinuant sa promenade et paraissant hésiter même à regarder son hôte.\\n\\n«Lorsque le souper fut terminé, Caderousse alla lui-même ouvrir la\\nporte.\\n\\n«--Je crois que l'orage se calme, dit-il.\\n\\n«Mais en ce moment, comme pour lui donner un démenti, un coup de\\ntonnerre terrible ébranla la maison, et une bouffée de vent mêlée de\\npluie entra, qui éteignit la lampe.\\n\\n«Caderousse referma la porte; sa femme alluma une chandelle au brasier\\nmourant.\\n\\n«--Tenez, dit-elle au bijoutier, vous devez être fatigué; j'ai mis des\\ndraps blancs au lit, montez vous coucher et dormez bien.\\n\\n«Joannès resta encore un instant pour s'assurer que l'ouragan ne se\\ncalmait point, et lorsqu'il eut acquis la certitude que le tonnerre et\\nla pluie ne faisaient qu'aller en augmentant, il souhaita le bonjour à\\nses hôtes et monta l'escalier.\\n\\n«Il passait au-dessus de ma tête, et j'entendais chaque marche craquer\\nsous ses pas.\\n\\n«La Carconte le suivit d'un oeil avide, tandis qu'au contraire\\nCaderousse lui tournait le dos et ne regardait pas même de son côté.\\n\\n«Tous ces détails, qui sont revenus à mon esprit depuis ce temps-là, ne\\nme frappèrent point au moment où ils se passaient sous mes yeux; il n'y\\navait, à tout prendre, rien que de naturel dans ce qui arrivait, et, à\\npart l'histoire du diamant qui me paraissait un peu invraisemblable,\\ntout allait de source. Aussi comme j'étais écrasé de fatigue, que je\\ncomptais profiter moi-même du premier répit que la tempête donnerait aux\\néléments, je résolus de dormir quelques heures et de m'éloigner au\\nmilieu de la nuit.\\n\\n«J'entendais dans la pièce au-dessus le bijoutier, qui prenait de son\\ncôté toutes ses dispositions pour passer la meilleure nuit possible.\\nBientôt son lit craqua sous lui; il venait de se coucher.\\n\\n«Je sentais mes yeux qui se fermaient malgré moi, et comme je n'avais\\nconçu aucun soupçon, je ne tentai point de lutter contre le sommeil; je\\njetai un dernier regard sur l'intérieur de la cuisine. Caderousse était\\nassis à côté d'une longue table, sur un de ces bancs de bois qui, dans\\nles auberges de village, remplacent les chaises; il me tournait le dos,\\nde sorte que je ne pouvais voir sa physionomie; d'ailleurs eût-il été\\ndans la position contraire, la chose m'eût encore été impossible,\\nattendu qu'il tenait sa tête ensevelie dans ses deux mains.\\n\\n«La Carconte le regarda quelque temps, haussa les épaules et vint\\ns'asseoir en face de lui.\\n\\n«En ce moment la flamme mourante gagna un reste de bois sec oublié par\\nelle; une lueur un peu plus vive éclaira le sombre intérieur.... La\\nCarconte tenait ses yeux fixés sur son mari, et comme celui-ci restait\\ntoujours dans la même position, je la vis étendre vers lui sa main\\ncrochue, et elle le toucha au front.\\n\\n«Caderousse tressaillit. Il me sembla que la femme remuait les lèvres,\\nmais, soit qu'elle parlât tout à fait bas, soit que mes sens fussent\\ndéjà engourdis par le sommeil, le bruit de sa parole n'arriva point\\njusqu'à moi. Je ne voyais même plus qu'à travers un brouillard et avec\\nce doute précurseur du sommeil pendant lequel on croit que l'on commence\\nun rêve. Enfin mes yeux se fermèrent, et je perdis conscience de\\nmoi-même.\\n\\n«J'étais au plus profond de mon sommeil, lorsque je fus réveillé par un\\ncoup de pistolet, suivi d'un cri terrible. Quelques pas chancelants\\nretentirent sur le plancher de la chambre, et une masse inerte vint\\ns'abattre dans l'escalier, juste au-dessus de ma tête.\\n\\n«Je n'étais pas encore bien maître de moi. J'entendais des gémissements,\\npuis des cris étouffés comme ceux qui accompagnent une lutte.\\n\\n«Un dernier cri, plus prolongé que les autres et qui dégénéra en\\ngémissements, vint me tirer complètement de ma léthargie.\\n\\n«Je me soulevai sur un bras, j'ouvris les yeux, qui ne virent rien dans\\nles ténèbres, et je portai la main à mon front, sur lequel il me\\nsemblait que dégouttait à travers les planches de l'escalier une pluie\\ntiède et abondante.\\n\\n«Le plus profond silence avait succédé à ce bruit affreux. J'entendis\\nles pas d'un homme qui marchait au-dessus de ma tête, ses pas firent\\ncraquer l'escalier. L'homme descendit dans la salle inférieure,\\ns'approcha de la cheminée et alluma une chandelle.\\n\\n«Cet homme, c'était Caderousse; il avait le visage pâle, et sa chemise\\nétait tout ensanglantée.\\n\\n«La chandelle allumée, il remonta rapidement l'escalier, et j'entendis\\nde nouveau ses pas rapides et inquiets.\\n\\n«Un instant après il redescendit. Il tenait à la main l'écrin; il\\ns'assura que le diamant était bien dedans, chercha un instant dans\\nlaquelle de ses poches il le mettrait; puis, sans doute, ne considérant\\npoint sa poche comme une cachette assez sûre, il le roula dans son\\nmouchoir rouge, qu'il tourna autour de son cou.\\n\\n«Puis il courut à l'armoire, en tira ses billets et son or, mit les uns\\ndans le gousset de son pantalon, l'autre dans la poche de sa veste, prit\\ndeux ou trois chemises, et, s'élançant vers la porte, il disparut dans\\nl'obscurité. Alors tout devint clair et lucide pour moi; je me reprochai\\nce qui venait d'arriver, comme si j'eusse été le vrai coupable. Il me\\nsembla entendre des gémissements: le malheureux bijoutier pouvait n'être\\npas mort; peut-être était-il en mon pouvoir, en lui portant secours, de\\nréparer une partie du mal non pas que j'avais fait, mais que j'avais\\nlaissé faire. J'appuyai mes épaules contre une de ces planches mal\\njointes qui séparaient l'espèce de tambour dans lequel j'étais couché de\\nla salle inférieure; les planches cédèrent, et je me trouvai dans la\\nmaison.\\n\\n«Je courus à la chandelle, et je m'élançai dans l'escalier; un corps le\\nbarrait en travers, c'était le cadavre de la Carconte.\\n\\n«Le coup de pistolet que j'avais entendu avait été tiré sur elle: elle\\navait la gorge traversée de part en part, et outre sa double blessure\\nqui coulait à flots, elle vomissait le sang par la bouche. Elle était\\ntout à fait morte. J'enjambai par-dessus son corps, et je passai.\\n\\n«La chambre offrait l'aspect du plus affreux désordre. Deux ou trois\\nmeubles étaient renversés; les draps, auxquels le malheureux bijoutier\\ns'était cramponné, traînaient par la chambre: lui-même était couché à\\nterre, la tête appuyée contre le mur, nageant dans une mare de sang qui\\ns'échappait de trois larges blessures reçues dans la poitrine.\\n\\n«Dans la quatrième était resté un long couteau de cuisine, dont on ne\\nvoyait que le manche.\\n\\n«Je marchai sur le second pistolet qui n'était point parti, la poudre\\nétant probablement mouillée.\\n\\n«Je m'approchai du bijoutier; il n'était pas mort effectivement: au\\nbruit que je fis, à l'ébranlement du plancher surtout, il rouvrit des\\nyeux hagards, parvint à les fixer un instant sur moi, remua les lèvres\\ncomme s'il voulait parler, et expira.\\n\\n«Cet affreux spectacle m'avait rendu presque insensé; du moment où je ne\\npouvais plus porter de secours à personne je n'éprouvais plus qu'un\\nbesoin, celui de fuir. Je me précipitai dans l'escalier, en enfonçant\\nmes mains dans mes cheveux et en poussant un rugissement de terreur.\\n\\n«Dans la salle inférieure, il y avait cinq ou six douaniers et deux ou\\ntrois gendarmes, toute une troupe armée.\\n\\n«On s'empara de moi; je n'essayai même pas de faire résistance, je\\nn'étais plus le maître de mes sens. J'essayai de parler, je poussai\\nquelques cris inarticulés, voilà tout.\\n\\n«Je vis que les douaniers et les gendarmes me montraient du doigt;\\nj'abaissai les yeux sur moi-même, j'étais tout couvert de sang. Cette\\npluie tiède que j'avais sentie tomber sur moi à travers les planches de\\nl'escalier, c'était le sang de la Carconte.\\n\\n«Je montrai du doigt l'endroit où j'étais caché.\\n\\n«--Que veut-il dire? demanda un gendarme.\\n\\n«Un douanier alla voir.\\n\\n«--Il veut dire qu'il est passé par là, répondit-il.\\n\\n«Et il montra le trou par lequel j'avais passé effectivement.\\n\\n«Alors, je compris qu'on me prenait pour l'assassin. Je retrouvai la\\nvoix, je retrouvai la force; je me dégageai des mains des deux hommes\\nqui me tenaient, en m'écriant:\\n\\n«--Ce n'est pas moi! ce n'est pas moi!\\n\\n«Deux gendarmes me mirent en joue avec leurs carabines.\\n\\n«--Si tu fais un mouvement, dirent-ils, tu es mort.\\n\\n«--Mais, m'écriai-je, puisque je vous répète que ce n'est pas moi!\\n\\n«--Tu conteras ta petite histoire aux juges de Nîmes, répondirent-ils.\\nEn attendant, suis-nous; et si nous avons un conseil à te donner, c'est\\nde ne pas faire résistance.\\n\\n«Ce n'était point mon intention, j'étais brisé par l'étonnement et par\\nla terreur. On me mit les menottes, on m'attacha à la queue d'un cheval,\\net l'on me conduisit à Nîmes.\\n\\n«J'avais été suivi par un douanier; il m'avait perdu de vue aux environs\\nde la maison, il s'était douté que j'y passerais la nuit; il avait été\\nprévenir ses compagnons, et ils étaient arrivés juste pour entendre le\\ncoup de pistolet et pour me prendre au milieu de telles preuves de\\nculpabilité, que je compris tout de suite la peine que j'aurais à faire\\nreconnaître mon innocence.\\n\\n«Aussi, ne m'attachai-je qu'à une chose: ma première demande au juge\\nd'instruction fut pour le prier de faire chercher partout un certain\\nabbé Busoni, qui s'était arrêté dans la journée à l'auberge du\\nPont-du-Gard. Si Caderousse avait inventé une histoire, si cet abbé\\nn'existait pas, il était évident que j'étais perdu, à moins que\\nCaderousse ne fût pris à son tour et n'avouât tout.\\n\\n«Deux mois s'écoulèrent pendant lesquels, je dois le dire à la louange\\nde mon juge, toutes les recherches furent faites pour retrouver celui\\nque je lui demandais. J'avais déjà perdu tout espoir. Caderousse n'avait\\npoint été pris. J'allais être jugé à la première session, lorsque le 8\\nseptembre, c'est-à-dire trois mois et cinq jours après l'événement,\\nl'abbé Busoni, sur lequel je n'espérais plus, se présenta à la geôle,\\ndisant qu'il avait appris qu'un prisonnier désirait lui parler. Il\\navait su, disait-il, la chose à Marseille, et il s'empressait de se\\nrendre à mon désir.\\n\\n«Vous comprenez avec quelle ardeur je le reçus; je lui racontai tout ce\\ndont j'avais été témoin, j'abordai avec inquiétude l'histoire du\\ndiamant; contre mon attente elle était vraie de point en point; contre\\nmon attente encore, il ajouta une foi entière à tout ce que je lui dis.\\nCe fut alors qu'entraîné par sa douce charité, reconnaissant en lui une\\nprofonde connaissance des moeurs de mon pays, pensant que le pardon du\\nseul crime que j'eusse commis pouvait peut-être descendre de ses lèvres\\nsi charitables, je lui racontai, sous le sceau de la confession,\\nl'aventure d'Auteuil dans tous ses détails. Ce que j'avais fait par\\nentraînement obtint le même résultat que si je l'eusse fait par calcul,\\nl'aveu de ce premier assassinat, que rien ne me forçait de lui révéler,\\nlui prouva que je n'avais pas commis le second, et il me quitta en\\nm'ordonnant d'espérer, et en promettant de faire tout ce qui serait en\\nson pouvoir pour convaincre mes juges de mon innocence.\\n\\n«J'eus la preuve qu'en effet il s'était occupé de moi quand je vis ma\\nprison s'adoucir graduellement, et quand j'appris qu'on attendrait pour\\nme juger les assises qui devaient suivre celles pour lesquelles on se\\nrassemblait.\\n\\n«Dans cet intervalle, la Providence permit que Caderousse fût pris à\\nl'étranger et ramené en France. Il avoua tout, rejetant la préméditation\\net surtout l'instigation sur sa femme. Il fut condamné aux galères\\nperpétuelles, et moi mis en liberté.\\n\\n--Et ce fut alors, dit Monte-Cristo, que vous vous présentâtes chez moi\\nporteur d'une lettre de l'abbé Busoni?\\n\\n--Oui, Excellence, il avait pris à moi un intérêt visible.\\n\\n«--Votre état de contrebandier vous perdra, me dit-il; si vous sortez\\nd'ici, quittez-le.\\n\\n«--Mais mon père, demandai-je, comment voulez-vous que je vive et que je\\nfasse vivre ma pauvre soeur?\\n\\n«--Un de mes pénitents, me répondit-il, a une grande estime pour moi, et\\nm'a chargé de lui chercher un homme de confiance. Voulez-vous être cet\\nhomme? je vous adresserai à lui.\\n\\n«--Ô mon père! m'écriai-je, que de bonté!\\n\\n«--Mais vous me jurez que je n'aurai jamais à me repentir.»\\n\\n«J'étendis la main pour faire serment.\\n\\n«--C'est inutile, dit-il, je connais et j'aime les Corses, voici ma\\nrecommandation.\\n\\n«Et il écrivit les quelques lignes que je vous remis, et sur lesquelles\\nVotre Excellence eut la bonté de me prendre à son service. Maintenant je\\nle demande avec orgueil à Votre Excellence, a-t-elle jamais eu à se\\nplaindre de moi?\\n\\n--Non, répondit le comte; et, je le confesse avec plaisir, vous êtes un\\nbon serviteur, Bertuccio, quoique vous manquiez de confiance.\\n\\n--Moi, monsieur le comte!\\n\\n--Oui, vous. Comment se fait-il que vous ayez une soeur et un fils\\nadoptif, et que, cependant vous ne m'ayez jamais parlé ni de l'une ni de\\nl'autre!\\n\\n--Hélas! Excellence, c'est qu'il me reste à vous dire la partie la plus\\ntriste de ma vie. Je partis pour la Corse. J'avais hâte, vous le\\ncomprenez bien, de revoir et de consoler ma pauvre soeur; mais quand\\nj'arrivai à Rogliano, je trouvai la maison en deuil; il y avait eu une\\nscène horrible et dont les voisins gardent encore le souvenir! Ma pauvre\\nsoeur, selon mes conseils, résistait aux exigences de Benedetto, qui, à\\nchaque instant, voulait se faire donner tout l'argent qu'il y avait à la\\nmaison. Un matin, il la menaça, et disparut pendant toute la journée.\\nElle pleura, car cette chère Assunta avait pour le misérable un coeur de\\nmère. Le soir vint, elle l'attendit sans se coucher. Lorsque, à onze\\nheures, il rentra avec deux de ses amis, compagnons ordinaires de toutes\\nses folies, alors elle lui tendit les bras; mais eux s'emparèrent\\nd'elle, et l'un des trois, je tremble que ce ne soit cet infernal\\nenfant, l'un des trois s'écria:\\n\\n«--Jouons à la question, et il faudra bien qu'elle avoue où est son\\nargent.\\n\\n«Justement le voisin Wasilio était à Bastia; sa femme seule était restée\\nà la maison. Nul, excepté elle, ne pouvait ni voir ni entendre ce qui se\\npassait chez ma soeur. Deux retinrent la pauvre Assunta, qui ne pouvant\\ncroire à la possibilité d'un pareil crime, souriait à ceux qui allaient\\ndevenir ses bourreaux, le troisième alla barricader portes et fenêtres,\\npuis il revint, et tous trois réunis, étouffant les cris que la terreur\\nlui arrachait devant ces préparatifs plus sérieux, approchèrent les\\npieds d'Assunta du brasier sur lequel ils comptaient pour lui faire\\navouer où était caché notre petit trésor; mais, dans la lutte, le feu\\nprit à ses vêtements: ils lâchèrent alors la patiente, pour ne pas être\\nbrûlés eux-mêmes. Tout en flammes elle courut à la porte, mais la porte\\nétait fermée.\\n\\n«Elle s'élança vers la fenêtre, mais la fenêtre était barricadée. Alors\\nla voisine entendit des cris affreux: c'était Assunta qui appelait au\\nsecours. Bientôt sa voix fut étouffée; les cris devinrent des\\ngémissements, et le lendemain, après une nuit de terreur et d'angoisses\\nquand la femme de Wasilio se hasarda de sortir de chez elle et fit\\nouvrir la porte de notre maison par le juge, on trouva Assunta à moitié\\nbrûlée, mais respirant encore, les armoires forcées, l'argent disparu.\\nQuant à Benedetto, il avait quitté Rogliano pour n'y plus revenir;\\ndepuis ce jour je ne l'ai pas revu, et je n'ai pas même entendu parler\\nde lui.\\n\\n«Ce fut, reprit Bertuccio, après avoir appris ces tristes nouvelles, que\\nj'allai à Votre Excellence. Je n'avais plus à vous parler de Benedetto,\\npuisqu'il avait disparu, ni de ma soeur, puisqu'elle était morte.\\n\\n--Et qu'avez-vous pensé de cet événement? demanda Monte-Cristo.\\n\\n--Que c'était le châtiment du crime que j'avais commis, répondit\\nBertuccio. Ah! ces Villefort, c'était une race maudite.\\n\\n--Je le crois, murmura le comte avec un accent lugubre.\\n\\n--Et maintenant, n'est-ce pas, reprit Bertuccio, Votre Excellence\\ncomprend que cette maison que je n'ai pas revue depuis, que ce jardin où\\nje me suis retrouvé tout à coup, que cette place où j'ai tué un homme,\\nont pu me causer ces sombres émotions dont vous avez voulu connaître la\\nsource; car enfin je ne suis pas bien sûr que devant moi, là, à mes\\npieds, M. de Villefort ne soit pas couché dans la fosse qu'il avait\\ncreusé pour son enfant.\\n\\n--En effet, tout est possible, dit Monte-Cristo en se levant du banc où\\nil était assis; même, ajouta-t-il tout bas, que le procureur du roi ne\\nsoit pas mort. L'abbé Busoni a bien fait de vous envoyer à moi. Vous\\navez bien fait de me raconter votre histoire, car je n'aurai pas de\\nmauvaises pensées à votre sujet. Quant à ce Benedetto si mal nommé,\\nn'avez-vous jamais essayé de retrouver sa trace? n'avez-vous jamais\\ncherché à savoir ce qu'il était devenu?\\n\\n--Jamais, si j'avais su où il était, au lieu d'aller à lui, j'aurais fui\\ncomme devant un monstre. Non heureusement, jamais je n'en ai entendu\\nparler par qui que ce soit au monde, j'espère qu'il est mort.\\n\\n--N'espérez pas, Bertuccio, dit le comte; les méchants ne meurent pas\\nainsi, car Dieu semble les prendre sous sa garde pour en faire\\nl'instrument de ses vengeances.\\n\\n--Soit, dit Bertuccio. Tout ce que je demande au ciel seulement, c'est\\nde ne le revoir jamais. Maintenant, continua l'intendant en baissant la\\ntête, vous savez tout, monsieur le comte; vous êtes mon juge ici-bas\\ncomme Dieu le sera là-haut; ne me direz-vous point quelques paroles de\\nconsolation?\\n\\n--Vous avez raison, en effet, et je puis vous dire ce que vous dirait\\nl'abbé Busoni: celui que vous avez frappé, ce Villefort, méritait un\\nchâtiment pour ce qu'il avait fait à vous et peut-être pour autre chose\\nencore. Benedetto, s'il vit, servira, comme je vous l'ai dit, à quelque\\nvengeance divine, puis sera puni à son tour. Quant à vous, vous n'avez\\nen réalité qu'un reproche à vous adresser: demandez-vous pourquoi, ayant\\nenlevé cet enfant à la mort, vous ne l'avez pas rendu à sa mère: là est\\nle crime, Bertuccio.\\n\\n--Oui, monsieur, là est le crime et le véritable crime, car en cela j'ai\\nété un lâche. Une fois que j'eus rappelé l'enfant à la vie, je n'avais\\nqu'une chose à faire, vous l'avez dit, c'était de le renvoyer à sa mère.\\nMais, pour cela, il me fallait faire des recherches, attirer\\nl'attention, me livrer peut-être; je n'ai pas voulu mourir, je tenais à\\nla vie par ma soeur, par l'amour-propre inné chez nous autres de rester\\nentiers et victorieux dans notre vengeance; et puis enfin, peut-être,\\ntenais-je simplement à la vie par l'amour même de la vie. Oh! moi, je ne\\nsuis pas un brave comme mon pauvre frère!»\\n\\nBertuccio cacha son visage dans ses deux mains, et Monte-Cristo attacha\\nsur lui un long et indéfinissable regard.\\n\\nPuis, après un instant de silence, rendu plus solennel encore par\\nl'heure et par le lieu:\\n\\n«Pour terminer dignement cet entretien, qui sera le dernier sur ces\\naventures, monsieur Bertuccio, dit le comte avec un accent de mélancolie\\nqui ne lui était pas habituel, retenez bien mes paroles, je les ai\\nsouvent entendu prononcer par l'abbé Busoni lui-même: À tous maux il est\\ndeux remèdes: le temps et le silence. Maintenant, monsieur Bertuccio,\\nlaissez-moi me promener un instant dans ce jardin. Ce qui est une\\némotion poignante pour vous, acteur dans cette scène, sera pour moi une\\nsensation presque douce et qui donnera un double prix à cette propriété.\\nLes arbres, voyez-vous, monsieur Bertuccio ne plaisent que parce qu'ils\\nfont de l'ombre, et l'ombre elle-même ne plaît que parce qu'elle est\\npleine de rêveries et de visions. Voilà que j'ai acheté un jardin\\ncroyant acheter un simple enclos fermé de murs, et point du tout, tout à\\ncoup cet enclos se trouve être un jardin tout plein de fantômes, qui\\nn'étaient point portés sur le contrat. Or, j'aime les fantômes; je n'ai\\njamais entendu dire que les morts eussent fait en six mille ans autant\\nde mal que les vivants en font en un jour. Rentrez donc, monsieur\\nBertuccio, et allez dormir en paix. Si votre confesseur, au moment\\nsuprême, est moins indulgent que ne le fut l'abbé Busoni, faites-moi\\nvenir si je suis encore de ce monde, je vous trouverai des paroles qui\\nberceront doucement votre âme au moment où elle sera prête à se mettre\\nen route pour faire ce rude voyage qu'on appelle l'éternité.»\\n\\nBertuccio s'inclina respectueusement devant le comte, et s'éloigna en\\npoussant un soupir.\\n\\nMonte-Cristo resta seul; et, faisant quatre pas en avant:\\n\\n«Ici, près de ce platane, murmura-t-il, la fosse où l'enfant fut déposé:\\nlà-bas, la petite porte par laquelle on entrait dans le jardin; à cet\\nangle, l'escalier dérobé qui conduit à la chambre à coucher. Je ne crois\\npas avoir besoin d'inscrire tout cela sur mes tablettes, car voilà\\ndevant mes yeux, autour de moi, sous mes pieds, le plan en relief, le\\nplan vivant.»\\n\\nEt le comte, après un dernier tour dans ce jardin, alla retrouver sa\\nvoiture. Bertuccio, qui le voyait rêveur, monta sans rien dire sur le\\nsiège auprès du cocher.\\n\\nLa voiture reprit le chemin de Paris.\\n\\nLe soir même, à son arrivée à la maison des Champs-Élysées, le comte de\\nMonte-Cristo visita toute l'habitation comme eût pu le faire un homme\\nfamiliarisé avec elle depuis de longues années; pas une seule fois,\\nquoiqu'il marchât le premier, il n'ouvrit une porte pour une autre, et\\nne prit un escalier ou un corridor qui ne le conduisît pas directement\\noù il comptait aller. Ali l'accompagnait dans cette revue nocturne. Le\\ncomte donna à Bertuccio plusieurs ordres pour l'embellissement ou la\\ndistribution nouvelle du logis, et tirant sa montre, il dit au Nubien\\nattentif:\\n\\n«Il est onze heures et demie, Haydée ne peut tarder à arriver. A-t-on\\nprévenu les femmes françaises?»\\n\\nAli étendit la main vers l'appartement destiné à la belle Grecque, et\\nqui était tellement isolé qu'en cachant la porte derrière une tapisserie\\non pouvait visiter toute la maison sans se douter qu'il y eût là un\\nsalon et deux chambres habités; Ali, disons-nous donc, étendit la main\\nvers l'appartement, montra le nombre trois avec les doigts de sa main\\ngauche, et sur cette même main, mise à plat, appuyant sa tête, ferma les\\nyeux en guise de sommeil.\\n\\n«Ah! fit Monte-Cristo, habitué à ce langage, elles sont trois qui\\nattendent dans la chambre à coucher, n'est-ce pas?\\n\\n--Oui, fit Ali en agitant la tête de haut en bas.\\n\\n--Madame sera fatiguée ce soir, continua Monte-Cristo, et sans doute\\nelle voudra dormir; qu'on ne la fasse pas parler: les suivantes\\nfrançaises doivent seulement saluer leur nouvelle maîtresse et se\\nretirer; vous veillerez à ce que la suivante grecque ne communique pas\\navec les suivantes françaises.»\\n\\nAli s'inclina. Bientôt on entendit héler le concierge; la grille\\ns'ouvrit, une voiture roula dans l'allée et s'arrêta devant le perron.\\nLe comte descendit; la portière était déjà ouverte; il tendit la main à\\nune jeune femme enveloppée d'une mante de soie verte toute brodée d'or\\nqui lui couvrait la tête.\\n\\nLa jeune femme prit la main qu'on lui tendait, la baisa avec un certain\\namour mêlé de respect, et quelques mots furent échangés, tendrement de\\nla part de la jeune femme et avec une douce gravité de la part du comte,\\ndans cette langue sonore que le vieil Homère a mise dans la bouche de\\nses dieux.\\n\\nAlors, précédé d'Ali qui portait un flambeau de cire rose, la jeune\\nfemme, laquelle n'était autre que cette belle Grecque, compagne\\nordinaire de Monte-Cristo en Italie, fut conduite à son appartement,\\npuis le comte se retira dans le pavillon qu'il s'était réservé.\\n\\nÀ minuit et demi, toutes les lumières étaient éteintes dans la maison,\\net l'on eût pu croire que tout le monde dormait.\",\n",
       " 'XLVI': \"Le lendemain, vers deux heures de l'après-midi une calèche attelée de\\ndeux magnifiques chevaux anglais s'arrêta devant la porte de\\nMonte-Cristo; un homme vêtu d'un habit bleu, à boutons de soie de même\\ncouleur, d'un gilet blanc sillonné par une énorme chaîne d'or et d'un\\npantalon couleur noisette, coiffé de cheveux si noirs et descendant si\\nbas sur les sourcils, qu'on eût pu hésiter à les croire naturels tant\\nils semblaient peu en harmonie avec celles des rides inférieures qu'ils\\nne parvenaient point à cacher; un homme enfin de cinquante à\\ncinquante-cinq ans, et qui cherchait à en paraître quarante, passa sa\\ntête par la portière d'un coupé sur le panneau duquel était peinte une\\ncouronne de baron, et envoya son groom demander au concierge si le comte\\nde Monte-Cristo était chez lui.\\n\\nEn attendant, cet homme considérait, avec une attention si minutieuse\\nqu'elle devenait presque impertinente, l'extérieur de la maison, ce que\\nl'on pouvait distinguer du jardin, et la livrée de quelques domestiques\\nque l'on pouvait apercevoir allant et venant. L'oeil de cet homme était\\nvif, mais plutôt rusé que spirituel. Ses lèvres étaient si minces, qu'au\\nlieu de saillir en dehors elles rentraient dans la bouche; enfin la\\nlargeur et la proéminence des pommettes, signe infaillible d'astuce, la\\ndépression du front, le renflement de l'occiput, qui dépassait de\\nbeaucoup de larges oreilles des moins aristocratiques, contribuaient à\\ndonner, pour tout physionomiste, un caractère presque repoussant à la\\nfigure de ce personnage fort recommandable aux yeux du vulgaire par ses\\nchevaux magnifiques, l'énorme diamant qu'il portait à sa chemise et le\\nruban rouge qui s'étendait d'une boutonnière à l'autre de son habit.\\n\\nLe groom frappa au carreau du concierge et demanda:\\n\\n«N'est-ce point ici que demeure M. le comte de Monte-Cristo?\\n\\n--C'est ici que demeure Son Excellence, répondit le concierge, mais...»\\n\\nIl consulta Ali du regard.\\n\\nAli fit un signe négatif.\\n\\n«Mais?... demanda le groom.\\n\\n--Mais Son Excellence n'est pas visible, répondit le concierge.\\n\\n--En ce cas, voici la carte de mon maître, M. le baron Danglars. Vous\\nla remettrez au comte de Monte-Cristo, et vous lui direz qu'en allant à\\nla Chambre mon maître s'est détourné pour avoir l'honneur de le voir.\\n\\n--Je ne parle pas à Son Excellence, dit le concierge; le valet de\\nchambre fera la commission.»\\n\\nLe groom retourna vers la voiture.\\n\\n«Eh bien?» demanda Danglars.\\n\\nL'enfant, assez honteux de la leçon qu'il venait de recevoir, apporta à\\nson maître la réponse qu'il avait reçue du concierge.\\n\\n«Oh! fit celui-ci, c'est donc un prince que ce monsieur, qu'on\\nl'appelle Excellence, et qu'il n'y ait que son valet de chambre qui ait\\nle droit de lui parler; n'importe, puisqu'il a un crédit sur moi, il\\nfaudra bien que je le voie quand il voudra de l'argent.»\\n\\nEt Danglars se rejeta dans le fond de sa voiture en criant au cocher, de\\nmanière qu'on pût l'entendre de l'autre côté de la route:\\n\\n«À la Chambre des députés!»\\n\\nAu travers d'une jalousie de son pavillon, Monte-Cristo, prévenu à\\ntemps, avait vu le baron et l'avait étudié, à l'aide d'une excellente\\nlorgnette, avec non moins d'attention que M. Danglars en avait mis\\nlui-même à analyser la maison, le jardin et les livrées.\\n\\n«Décidément, fit-il avec un geste de dégoût et en faisant rentrer les\\ntuyaux de sa lunette dans leur fourreau d'ivoire, décidément c'est une\\nlaide créature que cet homme; comment, dès la première fois qu'on le\\nvoit, ne reconnaît-on pas le serpent au front aplati, le vautour au\\ncrâne bombé et la buse au bec tranchant!\\n\\n«Ali!» cria-t-il, puis il frappa un coup sur le timbre de cuivre. Ali\\nparut. «Appelez Bertuccio», dit-il.\\n\\nAu même moment Bertuccio entra.\\n\\n«Votre Excellence me faisait demander? dit l'intendant.\\n\\n--Oui, monsieur, dit le comte. Avez-vous vu les chevaux qui viennent de\\ns'arrêter devant ma porte?\\n\\n--Certainement, Excellence, ils sont même fort beaux.\\n\\n--Comment se fait-il, dit Monte-Cristo en fronçant le sourcil, quand je\\nvous ai demandé les deux plus beaux chevaux de Paris, qu'il y ait à\\nParis deux autres chevaux aussi beaux que les miens, et que ces chevaux\\nne soient pas dans mes écuries?»\\n\\nAu froncement de sourcil et à l'intonation sévère de cette voix, Ali\\nbaissa la tête.\\n\\n«Ce n'est pas ta faute, bon Ali, dit en arabe le comte avec une douceur\\nqu'on n'aurait pas cru pouvoir rencontrer ni dans sa voix, ni sur son\\nvisage; tu ne te connais pas en chevaux anglais, toi.»\\n\\nLa sérénité reparut sur les traits d'Ali.\\n\\n«Monsieur le comte, dit Bertuccio, les chevaux dont vous me parlez\\nn'étaient pas à vendre.\\n\\nMonte-Cristo haussa les épaules:\\n\\n«Sachez, monsieur l'intendant, que tout est toujours à vendre pour qui\\nsait y mettre le prix.\\n\\n--M. Danglars les a payés seize mille francs, monsieur le comte.\\n\\n--Eh bien, il fallait lui en offrir trente-deux mille; il est banquier,\\net un banquier ne manque jamais une occasion de doubler son capital.\\n\\n--Monsieur le comte parle-t-il sérieusement?» demanda Bertuccio.\\n\\nMonte-Cristo regarda l'intendant en homme étonné qu'on ose lui faire une\\nquestion.\\n\\n«Ce soir, dit-il, j'ai une visite à rendre; je veux que ces deux chevaux\\nsoient attelés à ma voiture avec un harnais neuf.»\\n\\nBertuccio se retira en saluant; près de la porte, il s'arrêta:\\n\\n«À quelle heure, dit-il, Son Excellence compte-t-elle faire cette\\nvisite?\\n\\n--À cinq heures, dit Monte-Cristo.\\n\\n--Je ferai observer à Votre Excellence qu'il est deux heures, hasarda\\nl'intendant.\\n\\n--Je le sais», se contenta de répondre Monte-Cristo.\\n\\nPuis se retournant vers Ali:\\n\\n«Faites passer tous les chevaux devant madame, dit-il, qu'elle choisisse\\nl'attelage qui lui conviendra le mieux, et qu'elle me fasse dire si\\nelle veut dîner avec moi: dans ce cas on servira chez elle; allez; en\\ndescendant, vous m'enverrez le valet de chambre.»\\n\\nAli venait à peine de disparaître, que le valet de chambre entra à son\\ntour.\\n\\n«Monsieur Baptistin, dit le comte, depuis un an vous êtes à mon service;\\nc'est le temps d'épreuve que j'impose d'ordinaire à mes gens: vous me\\nconvenez.»\\n\\nBaptistin s'inclina.\\n\\n«Reste à savoir si je vous conviens.\\n\\n--Oh! monsieur le comte! se hâta de dire Baptistin.\\n\\n--Écoutez jusqu'au bout, reprit le comte. Vous gagnez par an quinze\\ncents francs, c'est-à-dire les appointements d'un bon et brave officier\\nqui risque tous les jours sa vie; vous avez une table telle que beaucoup\\nde chefs de bureau, malheureux serviteurs infiniment plus occupés que\\nvous, en désireraient une pareille. Domestique, vous avez vous-même des\\ndomestiques qui ont soin de votre linge et de vos effets. Outre vos\\nquinze cents francs de gages, vous me volez, sur les achats que vous\\nfaites pour ma toilette, à peu près quinze cents autres francs par an.\\n\\n--Oh! Excellence!\\n\\n--Je ne m'en plains pas, monsieur Baptistin, c'est raisonnable;\\ncependant je désire que cela s'arrête là. Vous ne retrouveriez donc\\nnulle part un poste pareil à celui que votre bonne fortune vous a donné.\\nJe ne bats jamais mes gens, je ne jure jamais, je ne me mets jamais en\\ncolère, je pardonne toujours une erreur, jamais une négligence ou un\\noubli. Mes ordres sont d'ordinaire courts, mais clairs et précis; j'aime\\nmieux les répéter à deux fois et même à trois, que de les voir mal\\ninterprétés. Je suis assez riche pour savoir tout ce que je veux savoir,\\net je suis fort curieux, je vous en préviens. Si j'apprenais donc que\\nvous ayez parlé de moi en bien ou en mal, commenté mes actions,\\nsurveillé ma conduite, vous sortiriez de chez moi à l'instant même. Je\\nn'avertis jamais mes domestiques qu'une seule fois; vous voilà averti,\\nallez!»\\n\\nBaptistin s'inclina et fit trois ou quatre pas pour se retirer.\\n\\n«À propos, reprit le comte, j'oubliais de vous dire que, chaque année,\\nje place une certaine somme sur la tête de mes gens. Ceux que je renvoie\\nperdent nécessairement cet argent, qui profite à ceux qui restent et qui\\ny auront droit après ma mort. Voilà un an que vous êtes chez moi, votre\\nfortune est commencée, continuez-la.»\\n\\nCette allocution, faite devant Ali, qui demeurait impassible, attendu\\nqu'il n'entendait pas un mot de français, produisit sur M. Baptistin un\\neffet que comprendront tous ceux qui ont étudié la psychologie du\\ndomestique français.\\n\\n«Je tâcherai de me conformer en tous points aux désirs de Votre\\nExcellence, dit-il; d'ailleurs je me modèlerai sur M. Ali.\\n\\n--Oh! pas du tout, dit le comte avec une froideur de marbre. Ali a\\nbeaucoup de défauts mêlés à ses qualités; ne prenez donc pas exemple sur\\nlui, car Ali est une exception; il n'a pas de gages, ce n'est pas un\\ndomestique, c'est mon esclave, c'est mon chien; s'il manquait à son\\ndevoir, je ne le chasserais pas, lui, je le tuerais.»\\n\\nBaptistin ouvrit de grands yeux.\\n\\n«Vous doutez?» dit Monte-Cristo.\\n\\nEt il répéta à Ali les mêmes paroles qu'il venait de dire en français à\\nBaptistin.\\n\\nAli écouta, sourit, s'approcha de son maître, mit un genou à terre, et\\nlui baisa respectueusement la main.\\n\\nCe petit corollaire de la leçon mit le comble à la stupéfaction de M.\\nBaptistin.\\n\\nLe comte fit signe à Baptistin de sortir, et à Ali de le suivre. Tous\\ndeux passèrent dans son cabinet, et là ils causèrent longtemps.\\n\\nÀ cinq heures, le comte frappa trois coups sur son timbre. Un coup\\nappelait Ali, deux coups Baptistin, trois coups Bertuccio.\\n\\nL'intendant entra.\\n\\n«Mes chevaux! dit Monte-Cristo.\\n\\n--Ils sont à la voiture, Excellence, répliqua Bertuccio.\\nAccompagnerai-je monsieur le comte?\\n\\n--Non, le cocher, Baptistin et Ali, voilà tout.»\\n\\nLe comte descendit et vit attelés à sa voiture, les chevaux qu'il avait\\nadmirés le matin à la voiture de Danglars.\\n\\nEn passant près d'eux il leur jeta un coup d'oeil.\\n\\n«Ils sont beaux, en effet, dit-il, et vous avez bien fait de les\\nacheter, seulement c'était un peu tard.\\n\\n--Excellence, dit Bertuccio, j'ai eu bien de la peine à les avoir, et\\nils ont coûté bien cher.\\n\\n--Les chevaux en sont-ils moins beaux? demanda le comte en haussant les\\népaules.\\n\\n--Si Votre Excellence est satisfaite, dit Bertuccio, tout est bien. Où\\nva Votre Excellence?\\n\\n--Rue de la Chaussée-d'Antin, chez M. le baron Danglars.»\\n\\nCette conversation se passait sur le haut du perron. Bertuccio fit un\\npas pour descendre la première marche.\\n\\n«Attendez, monsieur, dit Monte-Cristo en l'arrêtant. J'ai besoin d'une\\nterre sur le bord de la mer, en Normandie, par exemple, entre le Havre\\net Boulogne. Je vous donne de l'espace, comme vous voyez. Il faudrait\\nque, dans cette acquisition, il y eût un petit port, une petite crique,\\nune petite baie, où puisse entrer et se tenir ma corvette; elle ne tire\\nque quinze pieds d'eau. Le bâtiment sera toujours prêt à mettre à la\\nmer, à quelque heure du jour ou de la nuit qu'il me plaise de lui donner\\nle signal. Vous vous informerez chez tous les notaires d'une propriété\\ndans les conditions que je vous explique; quand vous en aurez\\nconnaissance, vous irez la visiter, et si vous êtes content, vous\\nl'achèterez à votre nom. La corvette doit être en route pour Fécamp,\\nn'est-ce pas?\\n\\n--Le soir même où nous avons quitté Marseille, je l'ai vu mettre à la\\nmer.\\n\\n--Et le yacht?\\n\\n--Le yacht a ordre de demeurer aux Martigues.\\n\\n--Bien! Vous correspondrez de temps en temps avec les deux patrons qui\\nles commandent, afin qu'ils ne s'endorment pas.\\n\\n--Et pour le bateau à vapeur?\\n\\n--Qui est à Chalons?\\n\\n--Oui.\\n\\n--Même ordres que pour les deux navires à voiles.\\n\\n--Bien!\\n\\n--Aussitôt cette propriété achetée, j'aurai des relais de dix lieues en\\ndix lieues sur la route du Nord et sur la route du Midi.\\n\\n--Votre Excellence peut compter sur moi.»\\n\\nLe comte fit un signe de satisfaction, descendit les degrés, sauta dans\\nsa voiture, qui, entraînée au trot du magnifique attelage, ne s'arrêta\\nque devant l'hôtel du banquier. Danglars présidait une commission nommée\\npour un chemin de fer, lorsqu'on vint lui annoncer la visite du comte\\nde Monte-Cristo. La séance, au reste, était presque finie.\\n\\nAu nom du comte, il se leva.\\n\\n«Messieurs, dit-il en s'adressant à ses collègues, dont plusieurs\\nétaient des honorables membres de l'une ou l'autre Chambre,\\npardonnez-moi si je vous quitte ainsi; mais imaginez-vous que la maison\\nThomson et French, de Rome, m'adresse un certain comte de Monte-Cristo,\\nen lui ouvrant chez moi un crédit illimité. C'est la plaisanterie la\\nplus drôle que mes correspondants de l'étranger se soient encore permise\\nvis-à-vis de moi. Ma foi, vous le comprenez, la curiosité m'a saisi et\\nme tient encore; je suis passé ce matin chez le prétendu comte. Si\\nc'était un vrai comte, vous comprenez qu'il ne serait pas si riche.\\nMonsieur n'était pas visible. Que vous en semble? ne sont-ce point des\\nfaçons d'altesse ou de jolie femme que se donne là maître Monte-Cristo?\\nAu reste, la maison située aux Champs-Élysées et qui est à lui, je m'en\\nsuis informé, m'a paru propre. Mais un crédit illimité, reprit Danglars\\nen riant de son vilain sourire, rend bien exigeant le banquier chez qui\\nle crédit est ouvert. J'ai donc hâte de voir notre homme. Je me crois\\nmystifié. Mais ils ne savent point là-bas à qui ils ont affaire; rira\\nbien qui rira le dernier.»\\n\\nEn achevant ces mots et en leur donnant une emphase qui gonfla les\\nnarines de M. le baron, celui-ci quitta ses hôtes et passa dans un salon\\nblanc et or qui faisait grand bruit dans la Chaussée-d'Antin.\\n\\nC'est là qu'il avait ordonné d'introduire le visiteur pour l'éblouir du\\npremier coup.\\n\\nLe comte était debout, considérant quelques copies de l'Albane et du\\nFattore qu'on avait fait passer au banquier pour des originaux, et qui,\\ntoutes copies qu'elles étaient, juraient fort avec les chicorées d'or de\\ntoutes couleurs qui garnissaient les plafonds.\\n\\nAu bruit que fit Danglars en entrant, le comte se retourna.\\n\\nDanglars salua légèrement de la tête, et fit signe au comte de s'asseoir\\ndans un fauteuil de bois doré garni de satin blanc broché d'or.\\n\\nLe comte s'assit.\\n\\n«C'est à monsieur de Monte-Cristo que j'ai l'honneur de parler?\\n\\n--Et moi, répondit le comte, à monsieur le baron Danglars, chevalier de\\nla Légion d'honneur, membre de la Chambre des députés?»\\n\\nMonte-Cristo redisait tous les titres qu'il avait trouvés sur la carte\\ndu baron.\\n\\nDanglars sentit la botte et se mordit les lèvres.\\n\\n«Excusez-moi, monsieur, dit-il, de ne pas vous avoir donné du premier\\ncoup le titre sous lequel vous m'avez été annoncé; mais, vous le savez,\\nnous vivons sous un gouvernement populaire, et moi, je suis un\\nreprésentant des intérêts du peuple.\\n\\n--De sorte, répondit Monte-Cristo, que, tout en conservant l'habitude de\\nvous faire appeler baron, vous avez perdu celle d'appeler les autres,\\ncomte.\\n\\n--Ah! je n'y tiens pas même pour moi, monsieur, répondit négligemment\\nDanglars; ils m'ont nommé baron et fait chevalier de la Légion d'honneur\\npour quelques services rendus, mais....\\n\\n--Mais vous avez abdiqué vos titres, comme ont fait autrefois MM. de\\nMontmorency et de Lafayette? C'était un bel exemple à suivre, monsieur.\\n\\n\\n--Pas tout à fait, cependant, reprit Danglars embarrassé; pour les\\ndomestiques, vous comprenez....\\n\\n--Oui, vous vous appelez monseigneur pour vos gens; pour les\\njournalistes, vous vous appelez monsieur; et pour vos commettants,\\ncitoyen. Ce sont des nuances très applicables au gouvernement\\nconstitutionnel. Je comprends parfaitement.»\\n\\nDanglars se pinça les lèvres: il vit que, sur ce terrain-là, il n'était\\npas de force avec Monte-Cristo, il essaya donc de revenir sur un terrain\\nqui lui était plus familier.\\n\\n«Monsieur le comte, dit-il en s'inclinant, j'ai reçu une lettre d'avis\\nde la maison Thomson et French.\\n\\n--J'en suis charmé, monsieur le baron. Permettez-moi de vous traiter\\ncomme vous traitent vos gens, c'est une mauvaise habitude prise dans des\\npays où il y a encore des barons, justement parce qu'on n'en fait plus.\\nJ'en suis charmé, dis-je; je n'aurai pas besoin de me présenter\\nmoi-même, ce qui est toujours assez embarrassant. Vous aviez donc,\\ndisiez-vous, reçu une lettre d'avis?\\n\\n--Oui, dit Danglars; mais je vous avoue que je n'en ai pas parfaitement\\ncompris le sens.\\n\\n--Bah!\\n\\n--Et j'avais même eu l'honneur de passer chez vous pour vous demander\\nquelques explications.\\n\\n--Faites, monsieur, me voilà, j'écoute et suis prêt à vous entendre.\\n\\n--Cette lettre, dit Danglars, je l'ai sur moi, je crois (il fouilla dans\\nsa poche). Oui, la voici: cette lettre ouvre à M. le comte de\\nMonte-Cristo un crédit illimité sur ma maison.\\n\\n--Eh bien, monsieur le baron, que voyez-vous d'obscur là-dedans?\\n\\n--Rien, monsieur; seulement le mot _illimité_...\\n\\n--Eh bien, ce mot n'est-il pas français?... Vous comprenez, ce sont des\\nAnglo-Allemands qui écrivent.\\n\\n--Oh! si fait, monsieur, et du côté de la syntaxe il n'y a rien à\\nredire, mais il n'en est pas de même du côté de la comptabilité.\\n\\n--Est-ce que la maison Thomson et French, demanda Monte-Cristo de l'air\\nle plus naïf qu'il put prendre, n'est point parfaitement sûre, à votre\\navis, monsieur le baron? diable! cela me contrarierait, car j'ai\\nquelques fonds placés chez elle.\\n\\n--Ah! parfaitement sûre, répondit Danglars avec un sourire presque\\nrailleur; mais le sens du mot illimité, en matière de finances, est\\ntellement vague....\\n\\n--Qu'il est illimité, n'est-ce pas? dit Monte-Cristo.\\n\\n--C'est justement cela, monsieur, que je voulais dire. Or, le vague,\\nc'est le doute, et, dit le sage, dans le doute abstiens-toi.\\n\\n--Ce qui signifie, reprit Monte-Cristo, que si la maison Thomson et\\nFrench est disposée à faire des folies, la maison Danglars ne l'est pas\\nà suivre son exemple.\\n\\n--Comment cela, monsieur le comte?\\n\\n--Oui, sans doute, MM. Thomson et French font les affaires sans\\nchiffres; mais M. Danglars a une limite aux siennes; c'est un homme\\nsage, comme il disait tout à l'heure.\\n\\n--Monsieur, répondit orgueilleusement le banquier, personne n'a encore\\ncompté avec ma caisse.\\n\\n--Alors, répondit froidement Monte-Cristo, il paraît que c'est moi qui\\ncommencerai.\\n\\n--Qui vous dit cela?\\n\\n--Les explications que vous me demandez, monsieur, et qui ressemblent\\nfort à des hésitations...»\\n\\nDanglars se mordit les lèvres; c'était la seconde fois qu'il était battu\\npar cet homme et cette fois sur un terrain qui était le sien. Sa\\npolitesse railleuse n'était qu'affectée, et touchait à cet extrême si\\nvoisin qui est l'impertinence.\\n\\nMonte-Cristo, au contraire, souriait de la meilleure grâce du monde, et\\npossédait, quand il le voulait, un certain air naïf qui lui donnait bien\\ndes avantages.\\n\\n«Enfin, monsieur, dit Danglars après un moment de silence, je vais\\nessayer de me faire comprendre en vous priant de fixer vous-même la\\nsomme que vous comptez toucher chez moi.\\n\\n--Mais, monsieur, reprit Monte-Cristo décidé à ne pas perdre un pouce de\\nterrain dans la discussion, si j'ai demandé un crédit illimité sur vous,\\nc'est que je ne savais justement pas de quelles sommes j'aurais besoin.»\\n\\n\\nLe banquier crut que le moment était venu enfin de prendre le dessus; il\\nse renversa dans son fauteuil, et avec un lourd et orgueilleux sourire:\\n\\n«Oh! monsieur, dit-il, ne craignez pas de désirer; vous pourrez vous\\nconvaincre alors que le chiffre de la maison Danglars, tout limité qu'il\\nest, peut satisfaire les plus larges exigences, et dussiez-vous demander\\nun million....\\n\\n--Plaît-il? fit Monte-Cristo.\\n\\n--Je dis un million, répéta Danglars avec l'aplomb de la sottise.\\n\\n--Et que ferais-je d'un million? dit le comte. Bon Dieu! monsieur, s'il\\nne m'eût fallu qu'un million, je ne me serais pas fait ouvrir un crédit\\npour une pareille misère. Un million? mais j'ai toujours un million dans\\nmon portefeuille ou dans mon nécessaire de voyage.»\\n\\nEt Monte-Cristo retira d'un petit carnet où étaient ses cartes de visite\\ndeux bons de cinq cent mille francs chacun, payables au porteur, sur le\\nTrésor.\\n\\nIl fallait assommer et non piquer un homme comme Danglars. Le coup de\\nmassue fit son effet: le banquier chancela et eut le vertige; il ouvrit\\nsur Monte-Cristo deux yeux hébétés dont la prunelle se dilata\\neffroyablement.\\n\\n«Voyons, avouez-moi, dit Monte-Cristo, que vous vous défiez de la\\nmaison Thomson et French. Mon Dieu! c'est tout simple; j'ai prévu le\\ncas, et, quoique assez étranger aux affaires, j'ai pris mes précautions.\\nVoici donc deux autres lettres pareilles à celle qui vous est adressée,\\nl'une est de la maison Arestein et Eskoles, de Vienne, sur M. le baron\\nde Rothschild, l'autre est de la maison Baring, de Londres, sur M.\\nLaffitte. Dites un mot, monsieur, et je vous ôterai toute préoccupation,\\nen me présentant dans l'une ou l'autre de ces deux maisons.»\\n\\nC'en était fait, Danglars était vaincu; il ouvrit avec un tremblement\\nvisible la lettre de Vienne et la lettre de Londres, que lui tendait du\\nbout des doigts le comte, vérifia l'authenticité des signatures avec une\\nminutie qui eût été insultante pour Monte-Cristo, s'il n'eût pas fait la\\npart de l'égarement du banquier.\\n\\n«Oh! monsieur, voilà trois signatures qui valent bien des millions, dit\\nDanglars en se levant comme pour saluer la puissance de l'or\\npersonnifiée en cet homme qu'il avait devant lui. Trois crédits\\nillimités sur nos maisons! Pardonnez-moi, monsieur le comte, mais tout\\nen cessant d'être défiant, on peut demeurer encore étonné.\\n\\n--Oh! ce n'est pas une maison comme la vôtre qui s'étonnerait ainsi, dit\\nMonte-Cristo avec toute sa politesse; ainsi, vous pourrez donc m'envoyer\\nquelque argent, n'est-ce pas?\\n\\n--Parlez, monsieur le comte; je suis à vos ordres.\\n\\n--Eh bien, reprit Monte-Cristo, à présent que nous nous entendons, car\\nnous nous entendons, n'est-ce pas?»\\n\\nDanglars fit un signe de tête affirmatif.\\n\\n«Et vous n'avez plus aucune défiance? continua Monte-Cristo.\\n\\n--Oh! monsieur le comte! s'écria le banquier, je n'en ai jamais eu.\\n\\n--Non; vous désiriez une preuve, voilà tout. Eh bien, répéta le comte,\\nmaintenant que nous nous entendons, maintenant que vous n'avez plus\\naucune défiance, fixons, si vous le voulez bien, une somme générale pour\\nla première année: six millions, par exemple.\\n\\n--Six millions, soit! dit Danglars suffoqué.\\n\\n--S'il me faut plus, reprit machinalement Monte-Cristo, nous mettrons\\nplus; mais je ne compte rester qu'une année en France, et pendant cette\\nannée je ne crois pas dépasser ce chiffre... enfin nous verrons....\\nVeuillez, pour commencer, me faire porter cinq cent mille francs demain,\\nje serai chez moi jusqu'à midi, et d'ailleurs, si je n'y étais pas, je\\nlaisserais un reçu à mon intendant.\\n\\n--L'argent sera chez vous demain à dix heures du matin, monsieur le\\ncomte, répondit Danglars. Voulez-vous de l'or, ou des billets de banque,\\nou de l'argent?\\n\\n--Or et billets par moitié, s'il vous plaît.\\n\\nEt le comte se leva.\\n\\n«Je dois vous confesser une chose, monsieur le comte, dit Danglars à son\\ntour; je croyais avoir des notions exactes sur toutes les belles\\nfortunes de l'Europe, et cependant la vôtre, qui me paraît considérable,\\nm'était, je l'avoue, tout à fait inconnue; elle est récente?\\n\\n--Non, monsieur, répondit Monte-Cristo, elle est, au contraire, de fort\\nvieille date: c'était une espèce de trésor de famille auquel il était\\ndéfendu de toucher, et dont les intérêts accumulés ont triplé le\\ncapital; l'époque fixée par le testateur est révolue depuis quelques\\nannées seulement: ce n'est donc que depuis quelques années que j'en use,\\net votre ignorance à ce sujet n'a rien que de naturel; au reste, vous la\\nconnaîtrez mieux dans quelque temps.»\\n\\nEt le comte accompagna ces mots d'un de ces sourires pâles qui faisaient\\nsi grand-peur à Franz d'Épinay.\\n\\n«Avec vos goûts et vos intentions, monsieur, continua Danglars, vous\\nallez déployer dans la capitale un luxe qui va nous écraser tous, nous\\nautres pauvres petits millionnaires: cependant comme vous me paraissez\\namateur, car lorsque je suis entré vous regardiez mes tableaux, je vous\\ndemande la permission de vous faire voir ma galerie: tous tableaux\\nanciens, tous tableaux de maîtres garantis comme tels; je n'aime pas\\nles modernes.\\n\\n--Vous avez raison, monsieur, car ils ont en général un grand défaut:\\nc'est celui de n'avoir pas encore eu le temps de devenir des anciens.\\n\\n--Puis-je vous montrer quelques statues de Thorwaldsen, de Bartoloni, de\\nCanova, tous artistes étrangers? Comme vous voyez, je n'apprécie pas les\\nartistes français.\\n\\n--Vous avez le droit d'être injuste avec eux, monsieur, ce sont vos\\ncompatriotes.\\n\\n--Mais tout cela sera pour plus tard, quand nous aurons fait meilleure\\nconnaissance, pour aujourd'hui, je me contenterai, si vous le permettez\\ntoutefois, de vous présenter à Mme la baronne Danglars; excusez mon\\nempressement, monsieur le comte, mais un client comme vous fait presque\\npartie de la famille.»\\n\\nMonte-Cristo s'inclina, en signe qu'il acceptait l'honneur que le\\nfinancier voulait bien lui faire.\\n\\nDanglars sonna; un laquais, vêtu d'une livrée éclatante, parut.\\n\\n«Mme la baronne est-elle chez elle? demanda Danglars.\\n\\n--Oui, monsieur le baron, répondit le laquais.\\n\\n--Seule?\\n\\n--Non, madame a du monde.\\n\\n--Ce ne sera pas indiscret de vous présenter devant quelqu'un, n'est-ce\\npas, monsieur le comte? Vous ne gardez pas l'incognito?\\n\\n--Non, Monsieur le baron, dit en souriant Monte-Cristo, je ne me\\nreconnais pas ce droit-là.\\n\\n--Et qui est près de madame? M. Debray?» demanda Danglars avec une\\nbonhomie qui fit sourire intérieurement Monte-Cristo, déjà renseigné sur\\nles transparents secrets d'intérieur du financier.\\n\\n«M. Debray, oui, monsieur le baron», répondit le laquais.\\n\\nDanglars fit un signe de tête.\\n\\nPuis se tournant vers Monte-Cristo:\\n\\n«M. Lucien Debray, dit-il, est un ancien ami à nous, secrétaire intime\\ndu ministre de l'intérieur; quant à ma femme, elle a dérogé en\\nm'épousant, car elle appartient à une ancienne famille, c'est une\\ndemoiselle de Servières, veuve en premières noces de M. le colonel\\nmarquis de Nargonne.\\n\\n--Je n'ai pas l'honneur de connaître Mme Danglars; mais j'ai déjà\\nrencontré M. Lucien Debray.\\n\\n--Bah! dit Danglars, où donc cela?\\n\\n--Chez M. de Morcerf.\\n\\n--Ah! vous connaissez le petit vicomte, dit Danglars.\\n\\n--Nous nous sommes trouvés ensemble à Rome à l'époque du carnaval.\\n\\n--Ah! oui, dit Danglars; n'ai-je pas entendu parler de quelque chose\\ncomme une aventure singulière avec des bandits, des voleurs dans les\\nruines? Il a été tiré de là miraculeusement. Je crois qu'il a raconté\\nquelque chose de tout cela à ma femme et à ma fille à son retour\\nd'Italie.\\n\\n--Mme la baronne attend ces messieurs, revint dire le laquais.\\n\\n--Je passe devant pour vous montrer le chemin, fit Danglars en saluant.\\n\\n--Et moi, je vous suis», dit Monte-Cristo.\",\n",
       " 'XLVII': \"Le baron, suivi du comte, traversa une longue file d'appartements\\nremarquables par leur lourde somptuosité et leur fastueux mauvais goût,\\net arriva jusqu'au boudoir de Mme Danglars, petite pièce octogone tendue\\nde satin rose recouvert de mousseline des Indes; les fauteuils étaient\\nen vieux bois doré et en vieilles étoffes; les dessus des portes\\nreprésentaient des bergeries dans le genre de Boucher; enfin deux jolis\\npastels en médaillon, en harmonie avec le reste de l'ameublement,\\nfaisaient de cette petite chambre la seule de l'hôtel qui eût quelque\\ncaractère; il est vrai qu'elle avait échappé au plan général arrêté\\nentre M. Danglars et son architecte, une des plus hautes et des plus\\néminentes célébrités de l'Empire, et que c'était la baronne et Lucien\\nDebray seulement qui s'en étaient réservé la décoration. Aussi M.\\nDanglars, grand admirateur de l'antique à la manière dont le comprenait\\nle Directoire, méprisait-il fort ce coquet petit réduit, où, au reste,\\nil n'était admis en général qu'à la condition qu'il ferait excuser sa\\nprésence en amenant quelqu'un; ce n'était donc pas en réalité Danglars\\nqui présentait, c'était au contraire lui qui était présenté et qui était\\nbien ou mal reçu selon que le visage du visiteur était agréable ou\\ndésagréable à la baronne.\\n\\nMme Danglars, dont la beauté pouvait encore être citée, malgré ses\\ntrente-six ans, était à son piano, petit chef-d'oeuvre de marqueterie,\\ntandis que Lucien Debray, assis devant une table à ouvrage, feuilletait\\nun album.\\n\\nLucien avait déjà, avant son arrivée, eu le temps de raconter à la\\nbaronne bien des choses relatives au comte. On sait combien, pendant le\\ndéjeuner chez Albert, Monte-Cristo avait fait impression sur ses\\nconvives; cette impression, si peu impressionnable qu'il fût, n'était\\npas encore effacée chez Debray, et les renseignements qu'il avait donnés\\nà la baronne sur le comte s'en étaient ressentis. La curiosité de Mme\\nDanglars, excitée par les anciens détails venus de Morcerf et les\\nnouveaux détails venus de Lucien, était donc portée à son comble. Aussi\\ncet arrangement de piano et d'album n'était-il qu'une de ces petites\\nruses du monde à l'aide desquelles on voile les plus fortes précautions.\\nLa baronne reçut en conséquence M. Danglars avec un sourire, ce qui de\\nsa part n'était pas chose habituelle. Quant au comte, il eut, en échange\\nde son salut, une cérémonieuse, mais en même temps gracieuse révérence.\\n\\nLucien, de son côté, échangea avec le comte un salut de\\ndemi-connaissance, et avec Danglars un geste d'intimité.\\n\\n«Madame la baronne, dit Danglars, permettez que je vous présente M. le\\ncomte de Monte-Cristo, qui m'est adressé par mes correspondants de Rome\\navec les recommandations les plus instantes: je n'ai qu'un mot à en dire\\net qui va en un instant le rendre la coqueluche de toutes nos belles\\ndames; il vient à Paris avec l'intention d'y rester un an et de dépenser\\nsix millions pendant cette année; cela promet une série de bals, de\\ndîners, de médianoches, dans lesquels j'espère que M. le comte ne nous\\noubliera pas plus que nous ne l'oublierons nous-mêmes dans nos petites\\nfêtes.»\\n\\nQuoique la présentation fût assez grossièrement louangeuse, c'est, en\\ngénéral, une chose si rare qu'un homme venant à Paris pour dépenser en\\nune année la fortune d'un prince, que Mme Danglars jeta sur le comte un\\ncoup d'oeil qui n'était pas dépourvu d'un certain intérêt.\\n\\n«Et vous êtes arrivé, monsieur?... demanda la baronne.\\n\\n--Depuis hier matin, madame.\\n\\n--Et vous venez, selon votre habitude, à ce qu'on m'a dit, du bout du\\nmonde?\\n\\n--De Cadix cette fois, madame, purement et simplement.\\n\\n--Oh! vous arrivez dans une affreuse saison. Paris est détestable l'été;\\nil n'y a plus ni bals, ni réunions, ni fêtes. L'Opéra italien est à\\nLondres, l'Opéra français est partout, excepté à Paris; et quant au\\nThéâtre-Français, vous savez qu'il n'est plus nulle part. Il nous reste\\ndonc pour toute distraction quelques malheureuses courses au\\nChamp-de-Mars et à Satory. Ferez-vous courir, monsieur le comte?\\n\\n--Moi, madame, dit Monte-Cristo, je ferai tout ce qu'on fait à Paris, si\\nj'ai le bonheur de trouver quelqu'un qui me renseigne convenablement sur\\nles habitudes françaises.\\n\\n--Vous êtes amateur de chevaux, monsieur le comte?\\n\\n--J'ai passé une partie de ma vie en Orient, madame, et les Orientaux,\\nvous le savez, n'estiment que deux choses au monde: la noblesse des\\nchevaux et la beauté des femmes.\\n\\n--Ah! monsieur le comte, dit la baronne, vous auriez dû avoir la\\ngalanterie de mettre les femmes les premières.\\n\\n--Vous voyez, madame, que j'avais bien raison quand tout à l'heure je\\nsouhaitais un précepteur qui pût me guider dans les habitudes\\nfrançaises.»\\n\\nEn ce moment la camériste favorite de Mme la baronne Danglars entra, et\\ns'approchant de sa maîtresse, lui glissa quelques mots à l'oreille.\\n\\nMme Danglars pâlit.\\n\\n«Impossible! dit-elle.\\n\\n--C'est l'exacte vérité, cependant, madame», répondit la camériste.\\n\\nMme Danglars se retourna du côté de son mari.\\n\\n«Est-ce vrai, monsieur?\\n\\n--Quoi, madame? demanda Danglars visiblement agité.\\n\\n--Ce que me dit cette fille....\\n\\n--Et que vous dit-elle?\\n\\n--Elle me dit qu'au moment où mon cocher a été pour mettre mes chevaux\\nà ma voiture, il ne les a pas trouvés à l'écurie; que signifie cela, je\\nvous le demande?\\n\\n--Madame, dit Danglars, écoutez-moi.\\n\\n--Oh! je vous écoute, monsieur, car je suis curieuse de savoir ce que\\nvous allez me dire; je ferai ces messieurs juges entre nous, et je vais\\ncommencer par leur dire ce qu'il en est. Messieurs, continua la baronne,\\nM. le baron Danglars a dix chevaux à l'écurie; parmi ces dix chevaux, il\\ny en a deux qui sont à moi, des chevaux charmants, les plus beaux\\nchevaux de Paris; vous les connaissez, monsieur Debray, mes gris\\npommelé! Eh bien, au moment où Mme de Villefort m'emprunte ma voiture,\\noù je la lui promets pour aller demain au Bois, voilà les deux chevaux\\nqui ne se retrouvent plus! M. Danglars aura trouvé à gagner dessus\\nquelques milliers de francs, et il les aura vendus. Oh! la vilaine race,\\nmon Dieu! que celle des spéculateurs!\\n\\n--Madame, répondit Danglars, les chevaux étaient trop vifs, ils avaient\\nquatre ans à peine, ils me faisaient pour vous des peurs horribles.\\n\\n--Eh! monsieur, dit la baronne, vous savez bien que j'ai depuis un mois\\nà mon service le meilleur cocher de Paris, à moins toutefois que vous ne\\nl'ayez vendu avec les chevaux.\\n\\n--Chère amie je vous trouverai les pareils, de plus beaux même, s'il y\\nen a; mais des chevaux doux calmes, et qui ne m'inspirent plus pareille\\nterreur.»\\n\\nLa baronne haussa les épaules avec un air de profond mépris. Danglars ne\\nparut point s'apercevoir de ce geste plus que conjugal, et se retournant\\nvers Monte-Cristo:\\n\\n«En vérité, je regrette de ne pas vous avoir connu plus tôt, monsieur le\\ncomte, dit-il; vous montez votre maison?\\n\\n--Mais oui, dit le comte.\\n\\n--Je vous les eusse proposés. Imaginez-vous que je les ai donnés pour\\nrien, mais, comme je vous l'ai dit, je voulais m'en défaire: ce sont des\\nchevaux de jeune homme.\\n\\n--Monsieur, dit le comte, je vous remercie; j'en ai acheté ce matin\\nd'assez bons et pas trop cher. Tenez, voyez, monsieur Debray, vous êtes\\namateur, je crois?»\\n\\nPendant que Debray s'approchait de la fenêtre, Danglars s'approcha de sa\\nfemme.\\n\\n«Imaginez-vous, madame, lui dit-il tout bas, qu'on est venu m'offrir un\\nprix exorbitant de ces chevaux. Je ne sais quel est le fou en train de\\nse ruiner qui m'a envoyé ce matin son intendant, mais le fait est que\\nj'ai gagné seize mille francs dessus; ne me boudez pas, et je vous en\\ndonnerai quatre mille, et deux mille à Eugénie.»\\n\\nMme Danglars laissa tomber sur son mari un regard écrasant.\\n\\n«Oh! mon Dieu! s'écria Debray.\\n\\n--Quoi donc? demanda la baronne.\\n\\n--Mais je ne me trompe pas, ce sont vos chevaux, vos propres chevaux\\nattelés à la voiture du comte.\\n\\n--Mes gris pommelé!» s'écria Mme Danglars.\\n\\nEt elle s'élança vers la fenêtre.\\n\\n«En effet, ce sont eux», dit-elle.\\n\\nDanglars était stupéfait.\\n\\n«Est-ce possible? dit Monte-Cristo en jouant l'étonnement.\\n\\n--C'est incroyable!» murmura le banquier.\\n\\nLa baronne dit deux mots à l'oreille de Debray, qui s'approcha à son\\ntour de Monte-Cristo.\\n\\n«La baronne vous fait demander combien son mari vous a vendu son\\nattelage.\\n\\n--Mais je ne sais trop, dit le comte, c'est une surprise que mon\\nintendant m'a faite, et... qui m'a coûté trente mille francs, je\\ncrois.»\\n\\nDebray alla reporter la réponse à la baronne.\\n\\nDanglars était si pâle et si décontenancé, que le comte eut l'air de le\\nprendre en pitié.\\n\\n«Voyez, lui dit-il, combien les femmes sont ingrates: cette prévenance\\nde votre part n'a pas touché un instant la baronne; ingrate n'est pas le\\nmot, c'est folle que je devrais dire. Mais que voulez-vous, on aime\\ntoujours ce qui nuit; aussi, le plus court, croyez-moi, cher baron, est\\ntoujours de les laisser faire à leur tête; si elles se la brisent, au\\nmoins, ma foi! elles ne peuvent s'en prendre qu'à elles.»\\n\\nDanglars ne répondit rien, il prévoyait dans un prochain avenir une\\nscène désastreuse; déjà le sourcil de Mme la baronne s'était froncé, et\\ncomme celui de Jupiter olympien, présageait un orage; Debray, qui le\\nsentait grossir prétexta une affaire et partit. Monte-Cristo, qui ne\\nvoulait pas gâter la position qu'il voulait conquérir en demeurant plus\\nlongtemps, salua Mme Danglars et se retira, livrant le baron à la colère\\nde sa femme.\\n\\n«Bon! pensa Monte-Cristo en se retirant, j'en suis arrivé où j'en voulais\\nvenir; voilà que je tiens dans mes mains la paix du ménage et que je\\nvais gagner d'un seul coup le coeur de monsieur et le coeur de madame;\\nquel bonheur! Mais, ajouta-t-il, dans tout cela, je n'ai point été\\nprésenté à Mlle Eugénie Danglars, que j'eusse été cependant fort aise de\\nconnaître. Mais, reprit-il avec ce sourire qui lui était particulier,\\nnous voici à Paris, et nous avons du temps devant nous.... Ce sera pour\\nplus tard!...»\\n\\nSur cette réflexion, le comte monta en voiture et rentra chez lui.\\n\\nDeux heures après, Mme Danglars reçut une lettre charmante du comte de\\nMonte-Cristo, dans laquelle il lui déclarait que, ne voulant pas\\ncommencer ses débuts dans le monde parisien en désespérant une jolie\\nfemme, il la suppliait de reprendre ses chevaux.\\n\\nIls avaient le même harnais qu'elle leur avait vu le matin; seulement au\\ncentre de chaque rosette qu'ils portaient sur l'oreille, le comte avait\\nfait coudre un diamant.\\n\\nDanglars, aussi, eut sa lettre.\\n\\nLe comte lui demandait la permission de passer à la baronne ce caprice\\nde millionnaire, le priant d'excuser les façons orientales dont le\\nrenvoi des chevaux était accompagné.\\n\\nPendant la soirée, Monte-Cristo partit pour Auteuil, accompagné d'Ali.\\n\\nLe lendemain vers trois heures, Ali, appelé par un coup de timbre entra\\ndans le cabinet du comte.\\n\\n«Ali, lui dit-il, tu m'as souvent parlé de ton adresse à lancer le\\nlasso?»\\n\\nAli fit signe que oui et se redressa fièrement.\\n\\n«Bien!... Ainsi, avec le lasso, tu arrêterais un boeuf?»\\n\\nAli fit signe de la tête que oui.\\n\\n«Un tigre?»\\n\\nAli fit le même signe.\\n\\n«Un lion?»\\n\\nAli fit le geste d'un homme qui lance le lasso, et imita un rugissement\\nétranglé.\\n\\n«Bien, je comprends, dit Monte-Cristo, tu as chassé le lion?»\\n\\nAli fit un signe de tête orgueilleux.\\n\\n«Mais arrêterais-tu, dans leur course, deux chevaux?»\\n\\nAli sourit.\\n\\n«Eh bien, écoute, dit Monte-Cristo. Tout à l'heure une voiture passera\\nemportée par deux chevaux gris pommelé, les mêmes que j'avais hier.\\nDusses-tu te faire écraser, il faut que tu arrêtes cette voiture devant\\nma porte.»\\n\\nAli descendit dans la rue et traça devant la porte une ligne sur le\\npavé: puis il rentra et montra la ligne au comte, qui l'avait suivi des\\nyeux.\\n\\nLe comte lui frappa doucement sur l'épaule: c'était sa manière de\\nremercier Ali. Puis le Nubien alla fumer sa chibouque sur la borne qui\\nformait l'angle de la maison et de la rue, tandis que Monte-Cristo\\nrentrait sans plus s'occuper de rien.\\n\\nCependant, vers cinq heures, c'est-à-dire l'heure où le comte attendait\\nla voiture, on eût pu voir naître en lui les signes presque\\nimperceptibles d'une légère impatience: il se promenait dans une chambre\\ndonnant sur la rue, prêtant l'oreille par intervalles, et de temps en\\ntemps se rapprochant de la fenêtre, par laquelle il apercevait Ali\\npoussant des bouffées de tabac avec une régularité indiquant que le\\nNubien était tout à cette importante occupation.\\n\\nTout à coup on entendit un roulement lointain, mais qui se rapprochait\\navec la rapidité de la foudre; puis une calèche apparut dont le cocher\\nessayait inutilement de retenir les chevaux, qui s'avançaient furieux,\\nhérissés, bondissant avec des élans insensés.\\n\\nDans la calèche, une jeune femme et un enfant de sept à huit ans, se\\ntenant embrassés, avaient perdu par l'excès de la terreur jusqu'à la\\nforce de pousser un cri; il eût suffi d'une pierre sous la roue ou d'un\\narbre accroché pour briser tout à fait la voiture, qui craquait. La\\nvoiture tenait le milieu du pavé, et on entendait dans la rue les cris\\nde terreur de ceux qui la voyaient venir.\\n\\nSoudain Ali pose sa chibouque, tire de sa poche le lasso, le lance,\\nenveloppe d'un triple tour les jambes de devant du cheval de gauche, se\\nlaisse entraîner trois ou quatre pas par la violence de l'impulsion;\\nmais, au bout de trois ou quatre pas, le cheval enchaîné s'abat, tombe\\nsur la flèche, qu'il brise, et paralyse les efforts que fait le cheval\\nresté debout pour continuer sa course. Le cocher saisit cet instant de\\nrépit pour sauter en bas de son siège; mais déjà Ali a saisi les naseaux\\ndu second cheval avec ses doigts de fer, et l'animal, hennissant de\\ndouleur, s'est allongé convulsivement près de son compagnon.\\n\\nIl a fallu à tout cela le temps qu'il faut à la balle pour frapper le\\nbut.\\n\\nCependant il a suffi pour que de la maison en face de laquelle\\nl'accident est arrivé, un homme se soit élancé suivi de plusieurs\\nserviteurs. Au moment où le cocher ouvre la portière, il enlève de la\\ncalèche la dame, qui d'une main se cramponne au coussin, tandis que de\\nl'autre elle serre contre sa poitrine son fils évanoui. Monte-Cristo les\\nemporta tous les deux dans le salon, et les déposant sur un canapé:\\n\\n«Ne craignez plus rien, madame, dit-il; vous êtes sauvée.»\\n\\nLa femme revint à elle, et pour réponse elle lui présenta son fils, avec\\nun regard plus éloquent que toutes les prières.\\n\\nEn effet, l'enfant était toujours évanoui.\\n\\n«Oui, madame, je comprends, dit le comte en examinant l'enfant; mais,\\nsoyez tranquille, il ne lui est arrivé aucun mal, et c'est la peur seule\\nqui l'a mis dans cet état.\\n\\n--Oh! monsieur, s'écria la mère, ne me dites-vous pas cela pour me\\nrassurer? Voyez comme il est pâle! Mon fils, mon enfant! mon Édouard!\\nréponds donc à ta mère! Ah! monsieur! envoyez chercher un médecin. Ma\\nfortune à qui me rend mon fils!»\\n\\nMonte-Cristo fit de la main un geste pour calmer la mère éplorée; et,\\nouvrant un coffret, il en tira un flacon de Bohème, incrusté d'or,\\ncontenant une liqueur rouge comme du sang et dont il laissa tomber une\\nseule goutte sur les lèvres de l'enfant.\\n\\nL'enfant, quoique toujours pâle, rouvrit aussitôt les yeux.\\n\\nÀ cette vue, la joie de la mère fut presque un délire.\\n\\n«Où suis-je? s'écria-t-elle, et à qui dois-je tant de bonheur après une\\nsi cruelle épreuve?\\n\\n--Vous êtes, madame, répondit Monte-Cristo, chez l'homme le plus heureux\\nd'avoir pu vous épargner un chagrin.\\n\\n--Oh! maudite curiosité! dit la dame. Tout Paris parlait de ces\\nmagnifiques chevaux de Mme Danglars, et j'ai eu la folie de vouloir les\\nessayer.\\n\\n--Comment! s'écria le comte avec une surprise admirablement jouée, ces\\nchevaux sont ceux de la baronne?\\n\\n--Oui, monsieur, la connaissez-vous?\\n\\n--Mme Danglars?... j'ai cet honneur, et ma joie est double de vous voir\\nsauvée du péril que ces chevaux vous ont fait courir; car ce péril,\\nc'est à moi que vous eussiez pu l'attribuer: j'avais acheté hier ces\\nchevaux au baron; mais la baronne a paru tellement les regretter, que je\\nles lui ai renvoyés hier en la priant de les accepter de ma main.\\n\\n--Mais alors vous êtes donc le comte de Monte-Cristo dont Hermine m'a\\ntant parlé hier?\\n\\n--Oui, madame, fit le comte.\\n\\n--Moi, monsieur, je suis Mme Héloïse de Villefort.»\\n\\nLe comte salua en homme devant lequel on prononce un nom parfaitement\\ninconnu.\\n\\n«Oh! que M. de Villefort sera reconnaissant! reprit Héloïse car enfin il\\nvous devra notre vie à tous deux: vous lui avez rendu sa femme et son\\nfils. Assurément, sans votre généreux serviteur, ce cher enfant et moi,\\nnous étions tués.\\n\\n--Hélas! madame! je frémis encore du péril que vous avez couru.\\n\\n--Oh! j'espère que vous me permettrez de récompenser dignement le\\ndévouement de cet homme.\\n\\n--Madame, répondit Monte-Cristo, ne me gâtez pas Ali, je vous prie, ni\\npar des louanges, ni par des récompenses: ce sont des habitudes que je\\nne veux pas qu'il prenne. Ali est mon esclave; en vous sauvant la vie il\\nme sert, et c'est son devoir de me servir.\\n\\n--Mais il a risqué sa vie, dit Mme de Villefort, à qui ce ton de maître\\nimposait singulièrement.\\n\\n--J'ai sauvé cette vie, madame, répondit Monte-Cristo, par conséquent\\nelle m'appartient.»\\n\\nMme de Villefort se tut: peut-être réfléchissait-elle à cet homme qui,\\ndu premier abord, faisait une si profonde impression sur les esprits.\\n\\nPendant cet instant de silence, le comte put considérer à son aise\\nl'enfant que sa mère couvrait de baisers. Il était petit, grêle, blanc\\nde peau comme les enfants roux, et cependant une forêt de cheveux noirs,\\nrebelles à toute frisure, couvrait son front bombé, et, tombant sur ses\\népaules en encadrant son visage, redoublait la vivacité de ses yeux\\npleins de malice sournoise et de juvénile méchanceté; sa bouche, à peine\\nredevenue vermeille, était fine de lèvres et large d'ouverture; les\\ntraits de cet enfant de huit ans annonçaient déjà douze ans au moins.\\nSon premier mouvement fut de se débarrasser par une brusque secousse\\ndes bras de sa mère, et d'aller ouvrir le coffret d'où le comte avait\\ntiré le flacon d'élixir; puis aussitôt, sans en demander la permission à\\npersonne, et en enfant habitué à satisfaire tous ses caprices, il se mit\\nà déboucher les fioles.\\n\\n«Ne touchez pas à cela, mon ami, dit vivement le comte, quelques-unes de\\nces liqueurs sont dangereuses, non seulement à boire, mais même à\\nrespirer.»\\n\\nMme de Villefort pâlit et arrêta le bras de son fils qu'elle ramena vers\\nelle; mais, sa crainte calmée, elle jeta aussitôt sur le coffret un\\ncourt mais expressif regard que le comte saisit au passage.\\n\\nEn ce moment Ali entra.\\n\\nMme de Villefort fit un mouvement de joie, et ramena l'enfant plus près\\nd'elle encore:\\n\\n«Édouard, dit-elle, vois-tu ce bon serviteur: il a été bien courageux,\\ncar il a exposé sa vie pour arrêter les chevaux qui nous emportaient et\\nla voiture qui allait se briser. Remercie-le donc, car probablement sans\\nlui, à cette heure, serions-nous morts tous les deux.»\\n\\nL'enfant allongea les lèvres et tourna dédaigneusement la tête.\\n\\n«Il est trop laid», dit-il.\\n\\nLe comte sourit comme si l'enfant venait de remplir une de ses\\nespérances; quant à Mme de Villefort, elle gourmanda son fils avec une\\nmodération qui n'eût, certes, pas été du goût de Jean-Jacques Rousseau\\nsi le petit Édouard se fût appelé Émile.\\n\\n«Vois-tu, dit en arabe le comte à Ali, cette dame prie son fils de te\\nremercier pour la vie que tu leur as sauvée à tous deux, et l'enfant\\nrépond que tu es trop laid.»\\n\\nAli détourna un instant sa tête intelligente et regarda l'enfant sans\\nexpression apparente; mais un simple frémissement de sa narine apprit à\\nMonte-Cristo que l'Arabe venait d'être blessé au coeur.\\n\\n«Monsieur, demanda Mme de Villefort en se levant pour se retirer,\\nest-ce votre demeure habituelle que cette maison?\\n\\n--Non, madame, répondit le comte, c'est une espèce de pied-à-terre que\\nj'ai acheté: j'habite avenue des Champs-Élysées, n° 30. Mais je vois que\\nvous êtes tout à fait remise, et que vous désirez vous retirer. Je viens\\nd'ordonner qu'on attelle ces mêmes chevaux à ma voiture, et Ali, ce\\ngarçon si laid, dit-il en souriant à l'enfant, va avoir l'honneur de\\nvous reconduire chez vous, tandis que votre cocher restera ici pour\\nfaire raccommoder la calèche. Aussitôt cette besogne indispensable\\nterminée, un de mes attelages la reconduira directement chez Mme\\nDanglars.\\n\\n--Mais, dit Mme de Villefort, avec ces mêmes chevaux je n'oserai jamais\\nm'en aller.\\n\\n--Oh! vous allez voir, madame, dit Monte-Cristo; sous la main d'Ali, ils\\nvont devenir doux comme des agneaux.»\\n\\nEn effet, Ali s'était approché des chevaux qu'on avait remis sur leurs\\njambes avec beaucoup de peine. Il tenait à la main une petite éponge\\nimbibée de vinaigre aromatique; il en frotta les naseaux et les tempes\\ndes chevaux, couverts de sueur et d'écume, et presque aussitôt ils se\\nmirent à souffler bruyamment et à frissonner de tout leur corps durant\\nquelques secondes.\\n\\nPuis, au milieu d'une foule nombreuse que les débris de la voiture et le\\nbruit de l'événement avaient attirée devant la maison, Ali fit atteler\\nles chevaux au coupé du comte, rassembla les rênes, monta sur le siège,\\net, au grand étonnement des assistants qui avaient vu ces chevaux\\nemportés comme par un tourbillon, il fut obligé d'user vigoureusement du\\nfouet pour les faire partir et encore ne put-il obtenir des fameux gris\\npommelé, maintenant stupides, pétrifiés, morts, qu'un trot si mal assuré\\net si languissant qu'il fallut près de deux heures à Mme de Villefort\\npour regagner le faubourg Saint-Honoré, où elle demeurait.\\n\\nÀ peine arrivée chez elle, et les premières émotions de famille\\napaisées, elle écrivit le billet suivant à Mme Danglars:\\n\\n«Chère Hermine,\\n\\n«Je viens d'être miraculeusement sauvée avec mon fils par ce même comte\\nde Monte-Cristo dont nous avons tant parlé hier soir, et que j'étais\\nloin de me douter que je verrais aujourd'hui. Hier vous m'avez parlé de\\nlui avec un enthousiasme que je n'ai pu m'empêcher de railler de toute\\nla force de mon pauvre petit esprit, mais aujourd'hui je trouve cet\\nenthousiasme bien au-dessous de l'homme qui l'inspirait. Vos chevaux\\ns'étaient emportés au Ranelagh comme s'ils eussent été pris de frénésie,\\net nous allions probablement être mis en morceaux, mon pauvre Édouard et\\nmoi, contre le premier arbre de la route ou la première borne du\\nvillage, quand un Arabe, un Nègre, un Nubien, un homme noir enfin, au\\nservice du comte, a, sur un signe de lui, je crois, arrêté l'élan des\\nchevaux, au risque d'être brisé lui-même, et c'est vraiment un miracle\\nqu'il ne l'ait pas été. Alors le comte est accouru, nous a emportés chez\\nlui, Édouard et moi, et là a rappelé mon fils à la vie. C'est dans sa\\npropre voiture que j'ai été ramenée à l'hôtel; la vôtre vous sera\\nrenvoyée demain. Vous trouverez vos chevaux bien affaiblis depuis cet\\naccident; ils sont comme hébétés; on dirait qu'ils ne peuvent se\\npardonner à eux-mêmes de s'être laissé dompter par un homme. Le comte\\nm'a chargée de vous dire que deux jours de repos sur la litière et de\\nl'orge pour toute nourriture les remettront dans un état aussi\\nflorissant, ce qui veut dire aussi effrayant qu'hier.\\n\\n«Adieu! Je ne vous remercie pas de ma promenade, et, quand je réfléchis,\\nc'est pourtant de l'ingratitude que de vous garder rancune pour les\\ncaprices de votre attelage; car c'est à l'un de ces caprices que je dois\\nd'avoir vu le comte de Monte-Cristo, et l'illustre étranger me paraît, à\\npart les millions dont il dispose, un problème si curieux et si\\nintéressant, que je compte l'étudier à tout prix, dussé-je recommencer\\nune promenade au Bois avec vos propres chevaux.\\n\\n«Édouard a supporté l'accident avec un courage miraculeux. Il s'est\\névanoui, mais il n'a pas poussé un cri auparavant et n'a pas versé une\\nlarme après. Vous me direz encore que mon amour maternel m'aveugle; mais\\nil y a une âme de fer dans ce pauvre petit corps si frêle et si délicat.\\n\\n«Notre chère Valentine dit bien des choses à votre chère Eugénie; moi,\\nje vous embrasse de tout coeur.\\n\\n«HÉLOÏSE DE VILLEFORT.»\\n\\n«P.-S. Faites-moi donc trouver chez vous d'une façon quelconque avec ce\\ncomte de Monte-Cristo, je veux absolument le revoir. Au reste, je viens\\nd'obtenir de M. de Villefort qu'il lui fasse une visite; j'espère bien\\nqu'il la lui rendra.»\\n\\nLe soir, l'événement d'Auteuil faisait le sujet de toutes les\\nconversations: Albert le racontait à sa mère, Château-Renaud au\\nJockey-Club, Debray dans le salon du ministre; Beauchamp lui-même fit au\\ncomte la galanterie, dans son journal, d'un _fait divers_ de vingt\\nlignes, qui posa le noble étranger en héros auprès de toutes les femmes\\nde l'aristocratie.\\n\\nBeaucoup de gens allèrent se faire inscrire chez Mme de Villefort afin\\nd'avoir le droit de renouveler leur visite en temps utile et d'entendre\\nalors de sa bouche tous les détails de cette pittoresque aventure.\\n\\nQuant à M. de Villefort, comme l'avait dit Héloïse, il prit un habit\\nnoir, des gants blancs, sa plus belle livrée, et monta dans son carrosse\\nqui vint, le même soir, s'arrêter à la porte du numéro 30 de la maison\\ndes Champs-Élysées.\",\n",
       " 'XLVIII': \"Si le comte de Monte-Cristo eût vécu depuis longtemps dans le monde\\nparisien, il eût apprécié en toute sa valeur la démarche que faisait\\nprès de lui M. de Villefort.\\n\\nBien en cour, que le roi régnant fût de la branche aînée ou de la\\nbranche cadette, que le ministre gouvernant fût doctrinaire, libéral ou\\nconservateur; réputé habile par tous, comme on répute généralement\\nhabiles les gens qui n'ont jamais éprouvé d'échecs politiques; haï de\\nbeaucoup, mais chaudement protégé par quelques-uns sans cependant être\\naimé de personne, M. de Villefort avait une des hautes positions de la\\nmagistrature, et se tenait à cette hauteur comme un Harlay ou comme un\\nMolé. Son salon, régénéré par une jeune femme et par une fille de son\\npremier mariage à peine âgée de dix-huit ans, n'en était pas moins un de\\nces salons sévères de Paris où l'on observe le culte des traditions et\\nla religion de l'étiquette. La politesse froide, la fidélité absolue\\naux principes gouvernementaux, un mépris profond des théories et des\\nthéoriciens, la haine profonde des idéologues, tels étaient les éléments\\nde la vie intérieure et publique affichés par M. de Villefort.\\n\\nM. de Villefort n'était pas seulement magistrat, c'était presque un\\ndiplomate. Ses relations avec l'ancienne cour, dont il parlait toujours\\navec dignité et déférence, le faisaient respecter de la nouvelle, et il\\nsavait tant de choses que non seulement on le ménageait toujours, mais\\nencore qu'on le consultait quelquefois. Peut-être n'en eût-il pas été\\nainsi si l'on eût pu se débarrasser de M. de Villefort; mais il\\nhabitait, comme ces seigneurs féodaux rebelles à leur suzerain, une\\nforteresse inexpugnable. Cette forteresse, c'était sa charge de\\nprocureur du roi, dont il exploitait merveilleusement tous les\\navantages, et qu'il n'eût quittée que pour se faire élire député et pour\\nremplacer ainsi la neutralité par de l'opposition.\\n\\nEn général, M. de Villefort faisait ou rendait peu de visites. Sa femme\\nvisitait pour lui: c'était chose reçue dans le monde, où l'on mettait\\nsur le compte des graves et nombreuses occupations du magistrat ce qui\\nn'était en réalité qu'un calcul d'orgueil, qu'une quintessence\\nd'aristocratie, l'application enfin de cet axiome: _Fais semblant de\\nt'estimer, et on t'estimera_, axiome plus utile cent fois dans notre\\nsociété que celui des Grecs: _Connais-toi toi-même_, remplacé de nos\\njours par l'art moins difficile et plus avantageux de connaître les\\nautres.\\n\\nPour ses amis, M. de Villefort était un protecteur puissant, pour ses\\nennemis, c'était un adversaire sourd, mais acharné; pour les\\nindifférents, c'était la statue de la loi faite homme: abord hautain,\\nphysionomie impassible, regard terne et dépoli, ou insolemment perçant\\net scrutateur, tel était l'homme dont quatre révolutions habilement\\nentassées l'une sur l'autre avaient d'abord construit, puis cimenté le\\npiédestal.\\n\\nM. de Villefort avait la réputation d'être l'homme le moins curieux et\\nle moins banal de France; il donnait un bal tous les ans et n'y\\nparaissait qu'un quart d'heure, c'est-à-dire quarante-cinq minutes de\\nmoins que ne le fait le roi aux siens; jamais on ne le voyait ni aux\\nthéâtres, ni aux concerts, ni dans aucun lieu public, quelquefois, mais\\nrarement, il faisait une partie de whist, et l'on avait soin alors de\\nlui choisir des joueurs dignes de lui: c'était quelque ambassadeur,\\nquelque archevêque, quelque prince, quelque président, ou enfin quelque\\nduchesse douairière.\\n\\nVoilà quel était l'homme dont la voiture venait de s'arrêter devant la\\nporte de Monte-Cristo.\\n\\nLe valet de chambre annonça M. de Villefort au moment où le comte,\\nincliné sur une grande table, suivait sur une carte un itinéraire de\\nSaint-Pétersbourg en Chine.\\n\\nLe procureur du roi entra du même pas grave et compassé qu'il entrait au\\ntribunal; c'était bien le même homme, ou plutôt la suite du même homme\\nque nous avons vu autrefois substitut à Marseille. La nature,\\nconséquente avec ses principes, n'avait rien changé pour lui au cours\\nqu'elle devait suivre. De mince, il était devenu maigre, de pâle il\\nétait devenu jaune; ses yeux enfoncés étaient caves, et ses lunettes aux\\nbranches d'or, en posant sur l'orbite, semblaient faire partie de la\\nfigure; excepté sa cravate blanche, le reste de son costume était\\nparfaitement noir, et cette couleur funèbre n'était tranchée que par le\\nléger liséré de ruban rouge qui passait imperceptible par sa boutonnière\\net qui semblait une ligne de sang tracée au pinceau.\\n\\nSi maître de lui que fût Monte-Cristo, il examina avec une visible\\ncuriosité, en lui rendant son salut, le magistrat qui, défiant par\\nhabitude et peu crédule surtout quant aux merveilles sociales, était\\nplus disposé à voir dans le noble étranger--c'était ainsi qu'on appelait\\ndéjà Monte-Cristo--un chevalier d'industrie venant exploiter un nouveau\\nthéâtre, ou un malfaiteur en état de rupture de ban, qu'un prince du\\nSaint-Siège ou un sultan des _Mille et une Nuits_.\\n\\n«Monsieur, dit Villefort avec ce ton glapissant affecté par les\\nmagistrats dans leurs périodes oratoires, et dont ils ne peuvent ou ne\\nveulent pas se défaire dans la conversation, monsieur, le service\\nsignalé que vous avez rendu hier à ma femme et à mon fils me fait un\\ndevoir de vous remercier. Je viens donc m'acquitter de ce devoir et vous\\nexprimer toute ma reconnaissance.»\\n\\nEt, en prononçant ces paroles, l'oeil sévère du magistrat n'avait rien\\nperdu de son arrogance habituelle. Ces paroles qu'il venait de dire, il\\nles avait articulées avec sa voix de procureur général, avec cette\\nraideur inflexible de cou et d'épaules qui faisait comme nous le\\nrépétons, dire à ses flatteurs qu'il était la statue vivante de la loi.\\n\\n«Monsieur, répliqua le comte à son tour avec une froideur glaciale, je\\nsuis fort heureux d'avoir pu conserver un fils à sa mère, car on dit que\\nle sentiment de la maternité est le plus saint de tous, et ce bonheur\\nqui m'arrive vous dispensait, monsieur, de remplir un devoir dont\\nl'exécution m'honore sans doute, car je sais que M. de Villefort ne\\nprodigue pas la faveur qu'il me fait, mais qui, si précieuse qu'elle\\nsoit cependant, ne vaut pas pour moi la satisfaction intérieure.»\\n\\nVillefort, étonné de cette sortie à laquelle il ne s'attendait pas,\\ntressaillit comme un soldat qui sent le coup qu'on lui porte sous\\nl'armure dont il est couvert, et un pli de sa lèvre dédaigneuse indiqua\\nque dès l'abord il ne tenait pas le comte de Monte-Cristo pour un\\ngentilhomme bien civil.\\n\\nIl jeta les yeux autour de lui pour raccrocher à quelque chose la\\nconversation tombée, et qui semblait s'être brisée en tombant.\\n\\nIl vit la carte qu'interrogeait Monte-Cristo au moment où il était\\nentré, et il reprit:\\n\\n«Vous vous occupez de géographie, monsieur? C'est une riche étude, pour\\nvous surtout qui, à ce qu'on assure, avez vu autant de pays qu'il y en a\\nde gravés sur cet atlas.\\n\\n--Oui, monsieur, répondit le comte, j'ai voulu faire sur l'espèce\\nhumaine, prise en masse, ce que vous pratiquez chaque jour sur des\\nexceptions, c'est-à-dire une étude physiologique. J'ai pensé qu'il me\\nserait plus facile de descendre ensuite du tout à la partie, que de la\\npartie au tout. C'est un axiome algébrique qui veut que l'on procède du\\nconnu à l'inconnu, et non de l'inconnu au connu.... Mais asseyez-vous\\ndonc, monsieur, je vous en supplie.»\\n\\nEt Monte-Cristo indiqua de la main au procureur du roi un fauteuil que\\ncelui-ci fut obligé de prendre la peine d'avancer lui-même, tandis que\\nlui n'eut que celle de se laisser retomber dans celui sur lequel il\\nétait agenouillé quand le procureur du roi était entré; de cette façon le\\ncomte se trouva à demi tourné vers son visiteur, ayant le dos à la\\nfenêtre et le coude appuyé sur la carte géographique qui faisait, pour\\nle moment, l'objet de la conversation, conversation qui prenait, comme\\nelle l'avait fait chez Morcerf et chez Danglars, une tournure tout à\\nfait analogue, sinon à la situation, du moins aux personnages.\\n\\n«Ah! vous philosophez, reprit Villefort après un instant de silence,\\npendant lequel, comme un athlète qui rencontre un rude adversaire, il\\navait fait provision de force. Eh bien, monsieur, parole d'honneur! si,\\ncomme vous, je n'avais rien à faire, je chercherais une moins triste\\noccupation.\\n\\n--C'est vrai, monsieur, reprit Monte-Cristo, et l'homme est une laide\\nchenille pour celui qui l'étudie au microscope solaire. Mais vous venez\\nde dire, je crois, que je n'avais rien à faire. Voyons, par hasard,\\ncroyez-vous avoir quelque chose à faire, vous, monsieur? ou, pour parler\\nplus clairement, croyez-vous que ce que vous faites vaille la peine de\\ns'appeler quelque chose?»\\n\\nL'étonnement de Villefort redoubla à ce second coup si rudement porté\\npar cet étrange adversaire; il y avait longtemps que le magistrat ne\\ns'était entendu dire un paradoxe de cette force, ou plutôt, pour parler\\nplus exactement, c'était la première fois qu'il l'entendait.\\n\\nLe procureur du roi se mit à l'oeuvre pour répondre.\\n\\n«Monsieur, dit-il, vous êtes étranger, et, vous le dites vous-même, je\\ncrois, une portion de votre vie s'est écoulée dans les pays orientaux;\\nvous ne savez donc pas combien la justice humaine, expéditive en ces\\ncontrées barbares, a chez nous des allures prudentes et compassées.\\n\\n--Si fait, monsieur, si fait; c'est le _pede claudo_ antique. Je sais\\ntout cela, car c'est surtout de la justice de tous les pays que je me\\nsuis occupé, c'est la procédure criminelle de toutes les nations que\\nj'ai comparée à la justice naturelle; et, je dois le dire, monsieur,\\nc'est encore cette loi des peuples primitifs, c'est-à-dire la loi du\\ntalion, que j'ai le plus trouvée selon le coeur de Dieu.\\n\\n--Si cette loi était adoptée, monsieur, dit le procureur du roi, elle\\nsimplifierait fort nos codes, et c'est pour le coup que nos magistrats\\nn'auraient, comme vous le disiez tout à l'heure, plus grand-chose à\\nfaire.\\n\\n--Cela viendra peut-être, dit Monte-Cristo, vous savez que les\\ninventions humaines marchent du composé au simple, et que le simple est\\ntoujours la perfection.\\n\\n--En attendant, monsieur, dit le magistrat, nos codes existent avec\\nleurs articles contradictoires, tirés des coutumes gauloises, des lois\\nromaines, des usages francs; or, la connaissance de toutes ces lois-là,\\nvous en conviendrez, ne s'acquiert pas sans de longs travaux, et il faut\\nune longue étude pour acquérir cette connaissance, et une grande\\npuissance de tête, cette connaissance une fois acquise, pour ne pas\\nl'oublier.\\n\\n--Je suis de cet avis-là, monsieur; mais tout ce que vous savez, vous, à\\nl'égard de ce code français, je le sais moi, non seulement à l'égard du\\ncode de toutes les nations: les lois anglaises, turques, japonaises,\\nhindoues, me sont aussi familières que les lois françaises; et j'avais\\ndonc raison de dire que, relativement (vous savez que tout est relatif,\\nmonsieur), que relativement à tout ce que j'ai fait, vous avez bien peu\\nde chose à faire, et que relativement à ce que j'ai appris, vous avez\\nencore bien des choses à apprendre.\\n\\n--Mais dans quel but avez-vous appris tout cela?» reprit Villefort\\nétonné.\\n\\nMonte-Cristo sourit.\\n\\n«Bien, monsieur, dit-il; je vois que, malgré la réputation qu'on vous a\\nfaite d'homme supérieur, vous voyez toute chose au point de vue\\nmatériel et vulgaire de la société, commençant à l'homme et, finissant à\\nl'homme, c'est-à-dire au point de vue le plus restreint et le plus\\nétroit qu'il ait été permis à l'intelligence humaine d'embrasser.\\n\\n--Expliquez-vous, monsieur, dit Villefort de plus en plus étonné, je ne\\nvous comprends pas... très bien.\\n\\n--Je dis, monsieur, que, les yeux fixés sur l'organisation sociale des\\nnations, vous ne voyez que les ressorts de la machine, et non l'ouvrier\\nsublime qui la fait agir, je dis que vous ne reconnaissez devant vous et\\nautour de vous que les titulaires des places dont les brevets ont été\\nsignés par des ministres ou par un roi, et que les hommes que Dieu a mis\\nau-dessus des titulaires, des ministres et des rois, en leur donnant une\\nmission à poursuivre au lieu d'une place à remplir, je dis que ceux-là\\néchappent à votre courte vue. C'est le propre de la faiblesse humaine\\naux organes débiles et incomplets. Tobie prenait l'ange qui venait lui\\nrendre la vue pour un jeune homme ordinaire. Les nations prenaient\\nAttila, qui devait les anéantir, pour un conquérant comme tous les\\nconquérants et il a fallu que tous révélassent leurs missions célestes\\npour qu'on les reconnût; il a fallu que l'un dit: «Je suis l'ange du\\nSeigneur»; et l'autre: «Je suis le marteau de Dieu», pour que l'essence\\ndivine de tous deux fût révélée.\\n\\n--Alors, dit Villefort de plus en plus étonné et croyant parler à un\\nilluminé ou à un fou, vous vous regardez comme un de ces êtres\\nextraordinaires que vous venez de citer?\\n\\n--Pourquoi pas? dit froidement Monte-Cristo.\\n\\n--Pardon, monsieur, reprit Villefort abasourdi mais vous m'excuserez si,\\nen me présentant chez vous, j'ignorais me présenter chez un homme dont\\nles connaissances et dont l'esprit dépassent de si loin les\\nconnaissances ordinaires et l'esprit habituel des hommes. Ce n'est point\\nl'usage chez nous, malheureux corrompus de la civilisation, que les\\ngentilshommes possesseurs comme vous d'une fortune immense, du moins à\\nce qu'on assure, remarquez que je n'interroge pas, que seulement je\\nrépète, ce n'est pas l'usage, dis-je, que ces privilégiés des richesses\\nperdent leur temps à des spéculations sociales, à des rêves\\nphilosophiques, faits tout au plus pour consoler ceux que le sort a\\ndéshérités des biens de la terre.\\n\\n--Eh! monsieur, reprit le comte, en êtes-vous donc arrivé à la situation\\néminente que vous occupez sans avoir admis, et même sans avoir rencontré\\ndes exceptions, et n'exercez-vous jamais votre regard, qui aurait\\ncependant tant besoin de finesse et de sûreté, à deviner d'un seul coup\\nsur quel homme est tombé votre regard? Un magistrat ne devrait-il pas\\nêtre, non pas le meilleur applicateur de la loi, non pas le plus rusé\\ninterprète des obscurités de la chicane, mais une sonde d'acier pour\\néprouver les coeurs, mais une pierre de touche pour essuyer l'or dont\\nchaque âme est toujours faite avec plus ou moins d'alliage?\\n\\n--Monsieur, dit Villefort, vous me confondez, sur ma parole, et je n'ai\\njamais entendu parler personne comme vous faites.\\n\\n--C'est que vous êtes constamment resté enfermé dans le cercle des\\nconditions générales, et que vous n'avez jamais osé vous élever d'un\\ncoup d'aile dans les sphères supérieures que Dieu a peuplées d'êtres\\ninvisibles ou exceptionnels.\\n\\n--Et vous admettez, monsieur, que ces sphères existent, et que les êtres\\nexceptionnels et invisibles se mêlent à nous?\\n\\n--Pourquoi pas? est-ce que vous voyez l'air que vous respirez et sans\\nlequel vous ne pourriez pas vivre?\\n\\n--Alors, nous ne voyons pas ces êtres dont vous parlez?\\n\\n--Si fait, vous les voyez quand Dieu permet qu'ils se matérialisent,\\nvous les touchez, vous les coudoyez, vous leur parlez et ils vous\\nrépondent.\\n\\n--Ah! dit Villefort en souriant, j'avoue que je voudrais bien être\\nprévenu quand un de ces êtres se trouvera en contact avec moi.\\n\\n--Vous avez été servi à votre guise, monsieur; car vous avez été prévenu\\ntout à l'heure, et maintenant: encore, je vous préviens.\\n\\n--Ainsi vous-même?\\n\\n--Je suis un de ces êtres exceptionnels, oui, monsieur, et je crois que,\\njusqu'à ce jour, aucun homme ne s'est trouvé dans une position\\nsemblable à la mienne. Les royaumes des rois sont limités, soit par des\\nmontagnes, soit par des rivières, soit par un changement de moeurs, soit\\npar une mutation de langage. Mon royaume, à moi, est grand comme le\\nmonde, car je ne suis ni Italien, ni Français, ni Hindou, ni Américain,\\nni Espagnol: je suis cosmopolite. Nul pays ne peut dire qu'il m'a vu\\nnaître. Dieu seul sait quelle contrée me verra mourir. J'adopte tous les\\nusages, je parle toutes les langues. Vous me croyez Français, vous,\\nn'est-ce pas, car je parle français avec la même facilité et la même\\npureté que vous? eh bien! Ali, mon Nubien, me croit Arabe; Bertuccio,\\nmon intendant, me croit Romain; Haydée, mon esclave, me croit Grec. Donc\\nvous comprenez, n'étant d'aucun pays, ne demandant protection à aucun\\ngouvernement, ne reconnaissant aucun homme pour mon frère, pas un seul\\ndes scrupules qui arrêtent les puissants ou des obstacles qui paralysent\\nles faibles ne me paralyse ou ne m'arrête. Je n'ai que deux\\nadversaires; je ne dirai pas deux vainqueurs, car avec la persistance je\\nles soumets: c'est la distance et le temps. Le troisième, et le plus\\nterrible, c'est ma condition d'homme mortel. Celle-là seule peut\\nm'arrêter dans le chemin où je marche, et avant que j'aie atteint le but\\nauquel je tends: tout le reste, je l'ai calculé. Ce que les hommes\\nappellent les chances du sort, c'est-à-dire la ruine, le changement, les\\néventualités, je les ai toutes prévues; et si quelques-unes peuvent\\nm'atteindre, aucune ne peut me renverser. À moins que je ne meure, je\\nserai toujours ce que je suis; voilà pourquoi je vous dis des choses que\\nvous n'avez jamais entendues, même de la bouche des rois, car les rois\\nont besoin de vous et les autres hommes en ont peur. Qui est-ce qui ne\\nse dit pas, dans une société aussi ridiculement organisée que la nôtre:\\n«Peut-être un jour aurai-je affaire au procureur du roi!»\\n\\n--Mais vous-même, monsieur, pouvez-vous dire cela, car, du moment où\\nvous habitez la France, vous êtes naturellement soumis aux lois\\nfrançaises.\\n\\n--Je le sais, monsieur, répondit Monte-Cristo; mais quand je dois aller\\ndans un pays, je commence à étudier, par des moyens qui me sont propres,\\ntous les hommes dont je puis avoir quelque chose à espérer ou à\\ncraindre, et j'arrive à les connaître aussi bien, et même mieux\\npeut-être qu'ils ne se connaissent eux-mêmes. Cela amène ce résultat que\\nle procureur du roi, quel qu'il fût, à qui j'aurais affaire, serait\\ncertainement plus embarrassé que moi-même.\\n\\n--Ce qui veut dire, reprit avec hésitation Villefort, que la nature\\nhumaine étant faible, tout homme selon vous, a commis des... fautes?\\n\\n--Des fautes... ou des crimes, répondit négligemment Monte-Cristo.\\n\\n--Et que vous seul, parmi les hommes que vous ne reconnaissez pas pour\\nvos frères, vous l'avez dit vous-même, reprit Villefort d'une voix\\nlégèrement altérée, et que vous seul êtes parfait?\\n\\n--Non point parfait, répondit le comte; impénétrable, voilà tout. Mais\\nbrisons là-dessus, monsieur, si la conversation vous déplaît; je ne suis\\npas plus menacé de votre justice que vous ne l'êtes de ma double vue.\\n\\n--Non, non, monsieur! dit vivement Villefort, qui sans doute craignait\\nde paraître abandonner le terrain; non! Par votre brillante et presque\\nsublime conversation, vous m'avez élevé au-dessus des niveaux\\nordinaires; nous ne causons plus, nous dissertons. Or, vous savez\\ncombien les théologiens en chaire de Sorbonne, ou les philosophes dans\\nleurs disputes, se disent parfois de cruelles vérités: supposons que\\nnous faisons de la théologie sociale et de la philosophie théologique,\\nje vous dirai donc celle-ci, toute rude qu'elle est: Mon frère, vous\\nsacrifiez à l'orgueil; vous êtes au-dessus des autres, mais au-dessus de\\nvous il y a Dieu.\\n\\n--Au-dessus de tous, monsieur! répondit Monte-Cristo avec un accent si\\nprofond que Villefort frissonna involontairement. J'ai mon orgueil pour\\nles hommes, serpents toujours prêts à se dresser contre celui qui les\\ndépasse du front sans les écraser du pied. Mais je dépose cet orgueil\\ndevant Dieu, qui m'a tiré du néant pour me faire ce que je suis.\\n\\n--Alors, monsieur le comte, je vous admire, dit Villefort, qui pour la\\npremière fois dans cet étrange dialogue venait d'employer cette formule\\naristocratique vis-à-vis de l'étranger qu'il n'avait jusque-là appelé\\nque monsieur. Oui, je vous le dis, si vous êtes réellement fort,\\nréellement supérieur, réellement saint ou impénétrable, ce qui, vous\\navez raison, revient à peu près au même, soyez superbe, monsieur; c'est\\nla loi des dominations. Mais vous avez bien cependant une ambition\\nquelconque?\\n\\n--J'en ai une, monsieur.\\n\\n--Laquelle?\\n\\n--Moi aussi, comme cela est arrivé à tout homme une fois dans sa vie,\\nj'ai été enlevé par Satan sur la plus haute montagne de la terre; arrivé\\nlà, il me montra le monde tout entier, et, comme il avait dit autrefois\\nau Christ, il me dit à moi: «Voyons, enfant des hommes, pour m'adorer\\nque veux-tu?» Alors j'ai réfléchi longtemps, car depuis longtemps une\\nterrible ambition dévorait effectivement mon coeur; puis je lui\\nrépondis: «Écoute, j'ai toujours entendu parler de la Providence, et\\ncependant je ne l'ai jamais vue, ni rien qui lui ressemble, ce qui me\\nfait croire qu'elle n'existe pas; je veux être la Providence, car ce que\\nje sais de plus beau, de plus grand et de plus sublime au monde, c'est\\nde récompenser et de punir.» Mais Satan baissa la tête et poussa un\\nsoupir. «Tu te trompes, dit-il, la Providence existe; seulement tu ne la\\nvois pas, parce que, fille de Dieu, elle est invisible comme son père.\\nTu n'as rien vu qui lui ressemble, parce qu'elle procède par des\\nressorts cachés et marche par des voies obscures; tout ce que je puis\\nfaire pour toi, c'est de te rendre un des agents de cette Providence.»\\nLe marché fut fait; j'y perdrai peut-être mon âme mais n'importe, reprit\\nMonte-Cristo, et le marché serait à refaire que je le ferais encore.»\\n\\nVillefort regardait Monte-Cristo avec un sublime étonnement.\\n\\n«Monsieur le comte, dit-il, avez-vous des parents?\\n\\n--Non, monsieur, je suis seul au monde.\\n\\n--Tant pis!\\n\\n--Pourquoi? demanda Monte-Cristo.\\n\\n--Parce que vous auriez pu voir un spectacle propre à briser votre\\norgueil. Vous ne craignez que la mort, dites-vous?\\n\\n--Je ne dis pas que je la craigne, je dis qu'elle seule peut m'arrêter.\\n\\n--Et la vieillesse?\\n\\n--Ma mission sera remplie avant que je sois vieux.\\n\\n--Et la folie?\\n\\n--J'ai manqué de devenir fou, et vous connaissez l'axiome: _non bis in\\nidem_; c'est un axiome criminel, et qui, par conséquent, est de votre\\nressort.\\n\\n--Monsieur, reprit Villefort, il y a encore autre chose à craindre que\\nla mort, que la vieillesse ou que la folie: il y a, par exemple,\\nl'apoplexie, ce coup de foudre qui vous frappe sans vous détruire, et\\naprès lequel, cependant, tout est fini. C'est toujours vous, et\\ncependant vous n'êtes plus vous; vous qui touchiez, comme Ariel, à\\nl'ange, vous n'êtes plus qu'une masse inerte qui, comme Caliban, touche\\nà la bête; cela s'appelle tout bonnement, comme je vous le disais, dans\\nla langue humaine, une apoplexie. Venez, s'il vous plaît, continuer\\ncette conversation chez moi, monsieur le comte, un jour que vous aurez\\nenvie de rencontrer un adversaire capable de vous comprendre et avide de\\nvous réfuter, et je vous montrerai mon père, M. Noirtier de Villefort,\\nun des plus fougueux jacobins de la Révolution française, c'est-à-dire\\nla plus brillante audace mise au service de la plus vigoureuse\\norganisation; un homme qui, comme vous, n'avait peut-être pas vu tous\\nles royaumes de la terre, mais avait aidé à bouleverser un des plus\\npuissants; un homme qui, comme vous, se prétendait un des envoyés, non\\npas de Dieu, mais de l'Être suprême, non pas de la Providence, mais de\\nla Fatalité; eh bien, monsieur, la rupture d'un vaisseau sanguin dans\\nun lobe du cerveau a brisé tout cela, non pas en un jour, non pas en une\\nheure, mais en une seconde. La veille, M. Noirtier, ancien jacobin,\\nancien sénateur, ancien carbonaro, riant de la guillotine, riant du\\ncanon, riant du poignard, M. Noirtier, jouant avec les révolutions. M.\\nNoirtier, pour qui la France n'était qu'un vaste échiquier duquel pions,\\ntours, cavaliers et reine devaient disparaître pourvu que le roi fût\\nmat, M. Noirtier, si redoutable, était le lendemain _ce pauvre monsieur\\nNoirtier_ vieillard immobile, livré aux volontés de l'être le plus\\nfaible de la maison, c'est-à-dire de sa petite-fille Valentine; un\\ncadavre muet et glacé enfin, qui ne vit sans souffrance que pour donner\\nle temps à la matière d'arriver sans secousse à son entière\\ndécomposition.\\n\\n--Hélas! monsieur, dit Monte-Cristo, ce spectacle n'est étrange ni à\\nmes yeux ni à ma pensée; je suis quelque peu médecin, et j'ai, comme mes\\nconfrères, cherché plus d'une fois l'âme dans la matière vivante ou dans\\nla matière morte; et, comme la Providence, elle est restée invisible à\\nmes yeux, quoique présente à mon coeur. Cent auteurs, depuis Socrate,\\ndepuis Sénèque, depuis saint Augustin, depuis Gall, ont fait en prose ou\\nen vers le rapprochement que vous venez de faire; mais cependant je\\ncomprends que les souffrances d'un père puissent opérer de grands\\nchangements dans l'esprit de son fils. J'irai, monsieur, puisque vous\\nvoulez bien m'y engager, contempler au profit de mon humilité ce\\nterrible spectacle qui doit fort attrister votre maison.\\n\\n--Cela serait sans doute, si Dieu ne m'avait point donné une large\\ncompensation. En face du vieillard qui descend en se traînant vers la\\ntombe sont deux enfants qui entrent dans la vie: Valentine, une fille de\\nmon premier mariage avec mademoiselle de Saint-Méran, et Édouard, ce\\nfils à qui vous avez sauvé la vie.\\n\\n--Et que concluez-vous de cette compensation, monsieur? demanda\\nMonte-Cristo.\\n\\n--Je conclus, monsieur, répondit Villefort, que mon père, égaré par les\\npassions, a commis quelques-unes de ces fautes qui échappent à la\\njustice humaine, mais qui relèvent de la justice de Dieu, et que Dieu,\\nne voulant punir qu'une seule personne, n'a frappé que lui seul.»\\n\\nMonte-Cristo, le sourire sur les lèvres, poussa au fond du coeur un\\nrugissement qui eût fait fuir Villefort, si Villefort eût pu l'entendre.\\n\\n«Adieu, monsieur, reprit le magistrat, qui depuis quelque temps déjà\\ns'était levé et parlait debout, je vous quitte, emportant de vous un\\nsouvenir d'estime qui, je l'espère, pourra vous être agréable lorsque\\nvous me connaîtrez mieux, car je ne suis point un homme banal, tant s'en\\nfaut. Vous vous êtes fait d'ailleurs dans Mme de Villefort une amie\\néternelle.»\\n\\nLe comte salua et se contenta de reconduire jusqu'à la porte de son\\ncabinet seulement Villefort, lequel regagna sa voiture précédé de deux\\nlaquais qui, sur un signe de leur maître, s'empressaient de la lui\\nouvrir.\\n\\nPuis, quand le procureur du roi eut disparu:\\n\\n«Allons, dit Monte-Cristo en tirant avec effort un sourire de sa\\npoitrine oppressée; allons, assez de poison comme cela, et maintenant\\nque mon coeur en est plein, allons chercher l'antidote.»\\n\\nEt frappant un coup sur le timbre retentissant:\\n\\n«Je monte chez madame, dit-il à Ali; que dans une demi-heure la voiture\\nsoit prête!»\",\n",
       " 'XLIX': \"On se rappelle quelles étaient les nouvelles ou plutôt les anciennes\\nconnaissances du comte de Monte-Cristo qui demeuraient rue Meslay:\\nc'étaient Maximilien, Julie et Emmanuel.\\n\\nL'espoir de cette bonne visite qu'il allait faire, de ces quelques\\nmoments heureux qu'il allait passer, de cette lueur du paradis glissant\\ndans l'enfer où il s'était volontairement engagé, avait répandu, à\\npartir du moment où il avait perdu de vue Villefort, la plus charmante\\nsérénité sur le visage du comte, et Ali, qui était accouru au bruit du\\ntimbre, en voyant ce visage si rayonnant d'une joie si rare, s'était\\nretiré sur la pointe du pied et la respiration suspendue, comme pour ne\\npas effaroucher les bonnes pensées qu'il croyait voir voltiger autour de\\nson maître.\\n\\nIl était midi: le comte s'était réservé une heure pour monter chez\\nHaydée; on eût dit que la joie ne pouvait rentrer tout à coup dans cette\\nâme si longtemps brisée, et qu'elle avait besoin de se préparer aux\\némotions douces, comme les autres âmes ont besoin de se préparer aux\\némotions violentes.\\n\\nLa jeune Grecque était, comme nous l'avons dit, dans un appartement\\nentièrement séparé de l'appartement du comte. Cet appartement était tout\\nentier meublé à la manière orientale; c'est-à-dire que les parquets\\nétaient couverts d'épais tapis de Turquie, que des étoffes de brocart\\nretombaient le long des murailles, et que dans chaque pièce, un large\\ndivan régnait tout autour de la chambre avec des piles de coussins qui\\nse déplaçaient à la volonté de ceux qui en usaient.\\n\\nHaydée avait trois femmes françaises et une femme grecque. Les trois\\nfemmes françaises se tenaient dans la première pièce, prêtes à accourir\\nau bruit d'une petite sonnette d'or et à obéir aux ordres de l'esclave\\nromaïque, laquelle savait assez de français pour transmettre les\\nvolontés de sa maîtresse à ses trois caméristes, auxquelles Monte-Cristo\\navait recommandé d'avoir pour Haydée les égards que l'on aurait pour une\\nreine.\\n\\nLa jeune fille était dans la pièce la plus reculée de son appartement,\\nc'est-à-dire dans une espèce de boudoir rond, éclairé seulement par le\\nhaut, et dans lequel le jour ne pénétrait qu'à travers des carreaux de\\nverre rose. Elle était couchée à terre sur des coussins de satin bleu\\nbrochés d'argent, à demi renversée en arrière sur le divan, encadrant sa\\ntête avec son bras droit mollement arrondi, tandis que, du gauche, elle\\nfixait à travers ses lèvres le tube de corail dans lequel était enchâssé\\nle tuyau flexible d'un narguilé, qui ne laissait arriver la vapeur à sa\\nbouche que parfumée par l'eau de benjoin, à travers laquelle sa douce\\naspiration la forçait de passer.\\n\\nSa pose, toute naturelle pour une femme d'Orient, eût été pour une\\nFrançaise d'une coquetterie peut-être un peu affectée.\\n\\nQuant à sa toilette, c'était celle des femmes épirotes, c'est-à-dire un\\ncaleçon de satin blanc broché de fleurs roses, et qui laissait à\\ndécouvert deux pieds d'enfant qu'on eût crus de marbre de Paros, si on\\nne les eût vus se jouer avec deux petites sandales à la pointe\\nrecourbée, brodée d'or et de perles; une veste à longues raies bleues et\\nblanches, à larges manches fendues pour les bras, avec des boutonnières\\nd'argent et des boutons de perles; enfin une espèce de corset laissant,\\npar sa coupe ouverte en coeur, voir le cou et tout le haut de la\\npoitrine, et se boutonnant au-dessous du sein par trois boutons de\\ndiamant. Quant au bas du corset et au haut du caleçon, ils étaient\\nperdus dans une des ceintures aux vives couleurs et aux longues franges\\nsoyeuses qui font l'ambition de nos élégantes Parisiennes.\\n\\nLa tête était coiffée d'une petite calotte d'or brodée de perles,\\ninclinée sur le côté, et au-dessous de la calotte, du côté où elle\\ninclinait, une belle rose naturelle de couleur pourpre ressortait mêlée\\nà des cheveux si noirs qu'ils paraissaient bleus.\\n\\nQuant à la beauté de ce visage, c'était la beauté grecque dans toute la\\nperfection de son type, avec ses grands yeux noirs veloutés, son nez\\ndroit, ses lèvres de corail et ses dents de perles.\\n\\nPuis, sur ce charmant ensemble, la fleur de la jeunesse était répandue\\navec tout son éclat et tout son parfum; Haydée pouvait avoir dix-neuf ou\\nvingt ans.\\n\\nMonte-Cristo appela la suivante grecque, et fit demander à Haydée la\\npermission d'entrer auprès d'elle.\\n\\nPour toute réponse, Haydée fit signe à la suivante de relever la\\ntapisserie qui pendait devant la porte, dont le chambranle carré encadra\\nla jeune fille couchée comme un charmant tableau. Monte-Cristo s'avança.\\n\\nHaydée se souleva sur le coude qui tenait le narguilé, et tendant au\\ncomte sa main en même temps qu'elle l'accueillait avec un sourire:\\n\\n«Pourquoi, dit-elle dans la langue sonore des filles de Sparte et\\nd'Athènes, pourquoi me fais-tu demander la permission d'entrer chez moi?\\nN'es-tu plus mon maître, ne suis-je plus ton esclave?»\\n\\nMonte-Cristo sourit à son tour.\\n\\n«Haydée, dit-il, vous savez....\\n\\n--Pourquoi ne me dis-tu pas tu comme d'habitude? interrompit la jeune\\nGrecque; ai-je donc commis quelque faute? En ce cas il faut me punir,\\nmais non pas me dire vous.\\n\\n--Haydée, reprit le comte, tu sais que nous sommes en France, et par\\nconséquent que tu es libre.\\n\\n--Libre de quoi faire? demanda la jeune fille.\\n\\n--Libre de me quitter.\\n\\n--Te quitter!... et pourquoi te quitterais-je?\\n\\n--Que sais-je, moi? Nous allons voir le monde.\\n\\n--Je ne veux voir personne.\\n\\n--Et si parmi les beaux jeunes gens que tu rencontreras, tu en trouvais\\nquelqu'un qui te plût, je ne serais pas assez injuste....\\n\\n--Je n'ai jamais vu d'hommes plus beaux que toi, et je n'ai jamais aimé\\nque mon père et toi.\\n\\n--Pauvre enfant, dit Monte-Cristo, c'est que tu n'as guère parlé qu'à\\nton père et à moi.\\n\\n--Eh bien, qu'ai-je besoin de parler à d'autres? Mon père m'appelait _sa\\njoie_; toi, tu m'appelles _ton amour_, et tous deux vous m'appelez\\n_votre enfant_.\\n\\n--Tu te rappelles ton père, Haydée?»\\n\\nLa jeune fille sourit.\\n\\n«Il est là et là, dit-elle en mettant la main sur ses yeux et sur son\\ncoeur.\\n\\n--Et moi, où suis-je? demanda en souriant Monte-Cristo.\\n\\n--Toi, dit-elle, tu es partout.»\\n\\nMonte-Cristo prit la main d'Haydée pour la baiser; mais la naïve enfant\\nretira sa main et présenta son front.\\n\\n«Maintenant, Haydée, lui dit-il, tu sais que tu es libre, que tu es\\nmaîtresse, que tu es reine; tu peux garder ton costume ou le quitter à\\nta fantaisie; tu resteras ici quand tu voudras rester, tu sortiras quand\\ntu voudras sortir; il y aura toujours une voiture attelée pour toi; Ali\\net Myrto t'accompagneront partout et seront à tes ordres; seulement, une\\nseule chose, je te prie.\\n\\n--Dis.\\n\\n--Garde le secret sur ta naissance, ne dis pas un mot de ton passé; ne\\nprononce dans aucune occasion le nom de ton illustre père ni celui de ta\\npauvre mère.\\n\\n--Je te l'ai déjà dit, seigneur, je ne verrai personne.\\n\\n--Écoute, Haydée; peut-être cette réclusion tout orientale sera-t-elle\\nimpossible à Paris: continue d'apprendre la vie de nos pays du Nord\\ncomme tu l'as fait à Rome, à Florence, à Milan et à Madrid; cela te\\nservira toujours, que tu continues à vivre ici ou que tu retournes en\\nOrient.»\\n\\nLa jeune fille leva sur le comte ses grands yeux humides et répondit:\\n\\n«Ou que nous retournions en Orient, veux-tu dire, n'est-ce pas, mon\\nseigneur?\\n\\n--Oui, ma fille, dit Monte-Cristo; tu sais bien que ce n'est jamais moi\\nqui te quitterai. Ce n'est point l'arbre qui quitte la fleur, c'est la\\nfleur qui quitte l'arbre.\\n\\n--Je ne te quitterai jamais, seigneur, dit Haydée, car je suis sûre que\\nje ne pourrais pas vivre sans toi.\\n\\n--Pauvre enfant! dans dix ans je serai vieux, et dans dix ans tu seras\\njeune encore.\\n\\n--Mon père avait une longue barbe blanche, cela ne m'empêchait point de\\nl'aimer; mon père avait soixante ans, et il me paraissait plus beau que\\ntous les jeunes hommes que je voyais.\\n\\n--Mais voyons, dis-moi, crois-tu que tu t'habitueras ici?\\n\\n--Te verrai-je?\\n\\n--Tous les jours.\\n\\n--Eh bien, que me demandes-tu donc, seigneur?\\n\\n--Je crains que tu ne t'ennuies.\\n\\n--Non, seigneur, car le matin je penserai que tu viendras, et le soir je\\nme rappellerai que tu es venu; d'ailleurs, quand je suis seule, j'ai de\\ngrands souvenirs, je revois d'immenses tableaux, de grands horizons avec\\nle Pinde et l'Olympe dans le lointain; puis j'ai dans le coeur trois\\nsentiments avec lesquels on ne s'ennuie jamais: de la tristesse, de\\nl'amour et de la reconnaissance.\\n\\n--Tu es une digne fille de l'Épire, Haydée, gracieuse et poétique, et\\nl'on voit que tu descends de cette famille de déesses qui est née dans\\nton pays. Sois donc tranquille, ma fille, je ferai en sorte que ta\\njeunesse ne soit pas perdue, car si tu m'aimes comme ton père, moi, je\\nt'aime comme mon enfant.\\n\\n--Tu te trompes, seigneur; je n'aimais point mon père comme je t'aime;\\nmon amour pour toi est un autre amour: mon père est mort et je ne suis\\npas morte; tandis que toi, si tu mourais, je mourrais.»\\n\\nLe comte tendit la main à la jeune fille avec un sourire de profonde\\ntendresse; elle y imprima ses lèvres comme d'habitude.\\n\\nEt le comte, ainsi disposé à l'entrevue qu'il allait avoir avec Morrel\\net sa famille, partit en murmurant ces vers de Pindare:\\n\\n«La jeunesse est une fleur dont l'amour est le fruit.... Heureux le\\nvendangeur qui le cueille après l'avoir vu lentement mûrir.»\\n\\nSelon ses ordres, la voiture était prête. Il y monta, et la voiture,\\ncomme toujours, partit au galop.\",\n",
       " 'L': \"Le comte arriva en quelques minutes rue Meslay, n° 7.\\n\\nLa maison était blanche, riante et précédée d'une cour dans laquelle\\ndeux petits massifs contenaient d'assez belles fleurs.\\n\\nDans le concierge qui lui ouvrit cette porte le comte reconnut le vieux\\nCoclès. Mais comme celui-ci on se le rappelle, n'avait qu'un oeil, et\\nque depuis neuf ans cet oeil avait encore considérablement faibli,\\nCoclès ne reconnut pas le comte.\\n\\nLes voitures, pour s'arrêter devant l'entrée, devaient tourner, afin\\nd'éviter un petit jet d'eau jaillissant d'un bassin en rocaille,\\nmagnificence qui avait excité bien des jalousies dans le quartier, et\\nqui était cause qu'on appelait cette maison le _Petit-Versailles_.\\n\\nInutile de dire que dans le bassin manoeuvraient une foule de poissons\\nrouges et jaunes.\\n\\nLa maison, élevée au-dessus d'un étage de cuisines et caveaux, avait,\\noutre le rez-de-chaussée, deux étages pleins et des combles; les jeunes\\ngens l'avaient achetée avec les dépendances, qui consistaient en un\\nimmense atelier, en deux pavillons au fond d'un jardin et dans le\\njardin lui-même. Emmanuel avait, du premier coup d'oeil, vu dans cette\\ndisposition une petite spéculation à faire; il s'était réservé la\\nmaison, la moitié du jardin, et avait tiré une ligne, c'est-à-dire qu'il\\navait bâti un mur entre lui et les ateliers qu'il avait loués à bail\\navec les pavillons et la portion du jardin qui y était afférente; de\\nsorte qu'il se trouvait logé pour une somme assez modique, et aussi bien\\nclos chez lui que le plus minutieux propriétaire d'un hôtel du faubourg\\nSaint-Germain.\\n\\nLa salle à manger était de chêne, le salon d'acajou et de velours bleu;\\nla chambre à coucher de citronnier et de damas vert; il y avait en outre\\nun cabinet de travail pour Emmanuel, qui ne travaillait pas, et un salon\\nde musique pour Julie, qui n'était pas musicienne.\\n\\nLe second étage tout entier était consacré à Maximilien: il y avait là\\nune répétition exacte du logement de sa soeur, la salle à manger\\nseulement avait été convertie en une salle de billard où il amenait ses\\namis.\\n\\nIl surveillait lui-même le pansage de son cheval, et fumait son cigare à\\nl'entrée du jardin quand la voiture du comte s'arrêta à la porte.\\n\\nCoclès ouvrit la porte, comme l'avons dit, et Baptistin, s'élançant de\\nson siège, demanda si M. et Mme Herbault et M. Maximilien Morrel étaient\\nvisibles pour le comte de Monte-Cristo.\\n\\n«Pour le comte de Monte-Cristo! s'écria Morrel en jetant son cigare et\\nen s'élançant au-devant de son visiteur: je le crois bien que nous\\nsommes visibles pour lui! Ah! merci, cent fois merci, monsieur le comte,\\nde ne pas avoir oublié votre promesse.»\\n\\nEt le jeune officier serra si cordialement la main du comte, que\\ncelui-ci ne put se méprendre à la franchise de la manifestation, et il\\nvit bien qu'il avait été attendu avec impatience et reçu avec\\nempressement.\\n\\n«Venez, venez, dit Maximilien, je veux vous servir d'introducteur; un\\nhomme comme vous ne doit pas être annoncé par un domestique, ma soeur\\nest dans son jardin, elle casse des roses fanées; mon frère lit ses\\ndeux journaux, _La Presse_ et _les Débats_, à six pas d'elle, car\\npartout où l'on voit Mme Herbault, on n'a qu'à regarder dans un rayon de\\nquatre mètres, M. Emmanuel s'y trouve, et réciproquement, comme on dit à\\nl'École polytechnique.»\\n\\nLe bruit des pas fit lever la tête à une jeune femme de vingt à\\nvingt-cinq ans, vêtue d'une robe de chambre de soie, et épluchant avec\\nun soin tout particulier un rosier noisette.\\n\\nCette femme, c'était notre petite Julie, devenue, comme le lui avait\\nprédit le mandataire de la maison Thomson et French, Mme Emmanuel\\nHerbault.\\n\\nElle poussa un cri en voyant un étranger. Maximilien se mit à rire.\\n\\n«Ne te dérange pas, ma soeur, dit-il, monsieur le comte n'est que depuis\\ndeux ou trois jours à Paris, mais il sait déjà ce que c'est qu'une\\nrentière du Marais, et s'il ne le sait pas, tu vas le lui apprendre.\\n\\n--Ah! monsieur, dit Julie, vous amener ainsi, c'est une trahison de mon\\nfrère, qui n'a pas pour sa pauvre soeur la moindre coquetterie....\\nPenelon!... Penelon!...»\\n\\nUn vieillard qui bêchait une plate-bande de rosiers du Bengale ficha sa\\nbêche en terre et s'approcha, la casquette à la main, en dissimulant du\\nmieux qu'il le pouvait une chique enfoncée momentanément dans les\\nprofondeurs de ses joues. Quelques mèches blanches argentaient sa\\nchevelure encore épaisse, tandis que son teint bronzé et son oeil hardi\\net vif annonçaient le vieux marin, bruni au soleil de l'équateur et hâlé\\nau souffle des tempêtes.\\n\\n«Je crois que vous m'avez hélé, mademoiselle Julie, dit-il, me voilà.»\\n\\nPenelon avait conservé l'habitude d'appeler la fille de son patron Mlle\\nJulie, et n'avait jamais pu prendre celle de l'appeler Mme Herbault.\\n\\n«Penelon, dit Julie, allez prévenir M. Emmanuel de la bonne visite qui\\nnous arrive, tandis que M. Maximilien conduira monsieur au salon.»\\n\\nPuis se tournant vers Monte-Cristo:\\n\\n«Monsieur me permettra bien de m'enfuir une minute, n'est-ce pas?»\\n\\nEt sans attendre l'assentiment du comte, elle s'élança derrière un\\nmassif et gagna la maison par une allée latérale.\\n\\n«Ah çà! mon cher monsieur Morrel, dit Monte-Cristo, je m'aperçois avec\\ndouleur que je fais révolution dans votre famille.\\n\\n--Tenez, tenez, dit Maximilien en riant, voyez-vous là-bas le mari qui,\\nde son côté, va troquer sa veste contre une redingote? Oh! c'est qu'on\\nvous connaît rue Meslay, vous étiez annoncé, je vous prie de le croire.\\n\\n\\n--Vous me paraissez avoir là, monsieur, une heureuse famille, dit le\\ncomte, répondant à sa propre pensée.\\n\\n--Oh! oui, je vous en réponds, monsieur le comte, que voulez-vous? il ne\\nleur manque rien pour être heureux: ils sont jeunes, ils sont gais, ils\\ns'aiment, et avec leurs vingt-cinq mille livres de rente ils se\\nfigurent, eux qui ont cependant côtoyé tant d'immenses fortunes, ils se\\nfigurent posséder la richesse des Rothschild.\\n\\n--C'est peu, cependant, vingt-cinq mille livres de rente, dit\\nMonte-Cristo avec une douceur si suave qu'elle pénétra le coeur de\\nMaximilien comme eût pu le faire la voix d'un tendre père; mais ils ne\\ns'arrêteront pas là, nos jeunes gens, ils deviendront à leur tour\\nmillionnaires. Monsieur votre beau-frère est avocat... médecin?...\\n\\n--Il était négociant, monsieur le comte, et avait pris la maison de mon\\npauvre père. M. Morrel est mort en laissant cinq cent mille francs de\\nfortune; j'en avais une moitié et ma soeur l'autre, car nous n'étions\\nque deux enfants. Son mari, qui l'avait épousée sans avoir d'autre\\npatrimoine que sa noble probité, son intelligence de premier ordre et sa\\nréputation sans tache, a voulu posséder autant que sa femme. Il a\\ntravaillé jusqu'à ce qu'il eût amassé deux cent cinquante mille francs;\\nsix ans ont suffi. C'était, je vous le jure monsieur le comte, un\\ntouchant spectacle que celui de ces deux enfants si laborieux, si unis,\\ndestinés par leur capacité à la plus haute fortune, et qui, n'ayant rien\\nvoulu changer aux habitudes de la maison paternelle, ont mis six ans à\\nfaire ce que les novateurs eussent pu faire en deux ou trois, aussi\\nMarseille retentit encore des louanges qu'on n'a pu refuser à tant de\\ncourageuse abnégation. Enfin, un jour, Emmanuel vint trouver sa femme,\\nqui achevait de payer l'échéance.\\n\\n«--Julie, lui dit-il, voici le dernier rouleau de cent francs que vient\\nde me remettre Coclès et qui complète les deux cent cinquante mille\\nfrancs que nous avons fixés comme limite de nos gains. Seras-tu contente\\nde ce peu dont il va falloir nous contenter désormais? Écoute, la maison\\nfait pour un million d'affaires par an, et peut rapporter quarante mille\\nfrancs de bénéfices. Nous vendrons, si nous le voulons, la clientèle,\\ntrois cent mille francs dans une heure, car voici une lettre de M.\\nDelaunay, qui nous les offre en échange de notre fonds qu'il veut\\nréunir au sien. Vois ce que tu penses qu'il y ait à faire.\\n\\n«--Mon ami, dit ma soeur, la maison Morrel ne peut être tenue que par un\\nMorrel. Sauver à tout jamais des mauvaises chances de la fortune le nom\\nde notre père, cela ne vaut-il pas bien trois cent mille francs?\\n\\n«--Je le pensais, répondit Emmanuel; cependant je voulais prendre ton\\navis.\\n\\n«--Eh bien, mon ami, le voilà. Toutes nos rentrées sont faites, tous nos\\nbillets sont payés; nous pouvons tirer une barre au-dessous du compte de\\ncette quinzaine et fermer nos comptoirs; tirons cette barre et\\nfermons-le.» Ce qui fut fait à l'instant même. Il était trois heures: à\\ntrois heures un quart, un client se présenta pour faire assurer le\\npassage de deux navires; c'était un bénéfice de quinze mille francs\\ncomptant.\\n\\n«--Monsieur, dit Emmanuel, veuillez vous adresser pour cette assurance à\\nnotre confrère M. Delaunay. Quant à nous, nous avons quitté les\\naffaires.\\n\\n«--Et depuis quand? demanda le client étonné.\\n\\n«--Depuis un quart d'heure.\\n\\n«Et voilà, monsieur, continua en souriant Maximilien, comment ma soeur\\net mon beau-frère n'ont que vingt-cinq mille livres de rente.»\\n\\nMaximilien achevait à peine sa narration pendant laquelle le coeur du\\ncomte s'était dilaté de plus en plus, lorsque Emmanuel reparut, restauré\\nd'un chapeau et d'une redingote.\\n\\nIl salua en homme qui connaît la qualité du visiteur; puis, après avoir\\nfait faire au comte le tour du petit enclos fleuri, il le ramena vers la\\nmaison.\\n\\nLe salon était déjà embaumé de fleurs contenues à grand-peine dans un\\nimmense vase du Japon à anses naturelles. Julie, convenablement vêtue et\\ncoquettement coiffée (elle avait accompli ce tour de force en dix\\nminutes), se présenta pour recevoir le comte à son entrée.\\n\\nOn entendait caqueter les oiseaux d'une volière voisine; les branches\\ndes faux ébéniers et des acacias roses venaient border de leurs grappes\\nles rideaux de velours bleu: tout dans cette charmante petite retraite\\nrespirait le calme, depuis le chant de l'oiseau jusqu'au sourire des\\nmaîtres.\\n\\nLe comte depuis son entrée dans la maison s'était déjà imprégné de ce\\nbonheur; aussi restait-il muet, rêveur, oubliant qu'on l'attendait pour\\nreprendre la conversation interrompue après les premiers compliments.\\n\\nIl s'aperçut de ce silence devenue presque inconvenant, et s'arrachant\\navec effort à sa rêverie:\\n\\n«Madame, dit-il enfin, pardonnez-moi une émotion qui doit vous étonner,\\nvous, accoutumée à cette paix et à ce bonheur que je rencontre ici, mais\\npour moi, c'est chose si nouvelle que la satisfaction sur un visage\\nhumain, que je ne me lasse pas de vous regarder, vous et votre mari.\\n\\n--Nous sommes bien heureux, en effet, monsieur, répliqua Julie; mais\\nnous avons été longtemps à souffrir, et peu de gens ont acheté leur\\nbonheur aussi cher que nous.»\\n\\nLa curiosité se peignit sur les traits du comte.\\n\\n«Oh! c'est toute une histoire de famille, comme vous le disait l'autre\\njour Château-Renaud, reprit Maximilien; pour vous, monsieur le comte,\\nhabitué à voir d'illustres malheurs et des joies splendides, il y\\naurait peu d'intérêt dans ce tableau d'intérieur. Toutefois nous avons,\\ncomme vient de vous le dire Julie, souffert de bien vives douleurs,\\nquoiqu'elles fussent renfermées dans ce petit cadre....\\n\\n--Et Dieu vous a versé, comme il le fait pour tous, la consolation sur\\nla souffrance? demanda Monte-Cristo.\\n\\n--Oui, monsieur le comte, dit Julie; nous pouvons le dire, car il a\\nfait pour nous ce qu'il ne fait que pour ses élus; il nous a envoyé un\\nde ses anges.»\\n\\nLe rouge monta aux joues du comte, et il toussa pour avoir un moyen de\\ndissimuler son émotion en portant son mouchoir à sa bouche.\\n\\n«Ceux qui sont nés dans un berceau de pourpre et qui n'ont jamais rien\\ndésiré, dit Emmanuel, ne savent pas ce que c'est que le bonheur de\\nvivre; de même que ceux-là ne connaissent pas le prix d'un ciel pur, qui\\nn'ont jamais livré leur vie à la merci de quatre planches jetées sur une\\nmer en fureur.»\\n\\nMonte-Cristo se leva, et, sans rien répondre, car au tremblement de sa\\nvoix on eût pu reconnaître l'émotion dont il était agité, il se mit à\\nparcourir pas à pas le salon.\\n\\n«Notre magnificence vous fait sourire, monsieur le comte, dit\\nMaximilien, qui suivait Monte-Cristo des yeux.\\n\\n--Non, non, répondit Monte-Cristo fort pâle et comprimant d'une main\\nles battements de son coeur, tandis que, de l'autre, il montrait au\\njeune homme un globe de cristal sous lequel une bourse de soie reposait\\nprécieusement couchée sur un coussin de velours noir. Je me demandais\\nseulement à quoi sert cette bourse, qui, d'un côté, contient un papier,\\nce me semble, et de l'autre un assez beau diamant.»\\n\\nMaximilien prit un air grave et répondit:\\n\\n«Ceci, monsieur le comte, c'est le plus précieux de nos trésors de\\nfamille.\\n\\n--En effet, ce diamant est assez beau, répliqua Monte-Cristo.\\n\\n--Oh! mon frère ne vous parle pas du prix de la pierre, quoiqu'elle soit\\nestimée cent mille francs, monsieur le comte; il veut seulement vous\\ndire que les objets que renferme cette bourse sont les reliques; de\\nl'ange dont nous vous parlions tout à l'heure.\\n\\n--Voilà ce que je ne saurais comprendre, et cependant ce que je ne dois\\npas demander, madame, répliqua Monte-Cristo en s'inclinant;\\npardonnez-moi, je n'ai pas voulu être indiscret.\\n\\n--Indiscret, dites-vous? oh! que vous nous rendez heureux, monsieur le\\ncomte, au contraire, en nous offrant une occasion de nous étendre sur ce\\nsujet! Si nous cachions comme un secret la belle action que rappelle\\ncette bourse nous ne l'exposerions pas ainsi à la vue. Oh! nous\\nvoudrions pouvoir la publier dans tout l'univers, pour qu'un\\ntressaillement de notre bienfaiteur inconnu nous révélât sa présence.\\n\\n--Ah! vraiment! fit Monte-Cristo d'une voix étouffée.\\n\\n--Monsieur, dit Maximilien en soulevant le globe de cristal et en\\nbaisant religieusement la bourse de soie, ceci a touché la main d'un\\nhomme par lequel mon père a été sauvé de la mort, nous de la ruine, et\\nnotre nom de la honte; d'un homme grâce auquel nous autres, pauvres\\nenfants voués à la misère et aux larmes, nous pouvons entendre\\naujourd'hui des gens s'extasier sur notre bonheur. Cette lettre--et\\nMaximilien tirant un billet de la bourse le présenta au comte--cette\\nlettre fut écrite par lui un jour où mon père avait pris une résolution\\nbien désespérée, et ce diamant fut donné en dot à ma soeur par ce\\ngénéreux inconnu.»\\n\\nMonte-Cristo ouvrit la lettre et la lut avec une indéfinissable\\nexpression de bonheur, c'était le billet que nos lecteurs connaissent,\\nadressé à Julie et signé Simbad le marin.\\n\\n--Inconnu, dites-vous? Ainsi l'homme qui vous a rendu ce service est\\nresté inconnu pour vous?\\n\\n--Oui, monsieur, jamais nous n'avons eu le bonheur de serrer sa main; ce\\nn'est pas faute cependant d'avoir demandé à Dieu cette faveur, reprit\\nMaximilien; mais il y a eu dans toute cette aventure une mystérieuse\\ndirection que nous ne pouvons comprendre encore; tout a été conduit par\\nune main invisible, puissante comme celle d'un enchanteur.\\n\\n--Oh! dit Julie, je n'ai pas encore perdu tout espoir de baiser un jour\\ncette main comme je baise la bourse qu'elle a touchée. Il y a quatre\\nans, Penelon était à Trieste: Penelon, monsieur le comte, c'est ce brave\\nmarin que vous avez vu une bêche à la main, et qui, de contremaître,\\ns'est fait jardinier. Penelon, étant donc à Trieste, vit sur le quai un\\nAnglais qui allait s'embarquer sur un yacht, et il reconnut celui qui\\nvint chez mon père le 5 juin 1829, et qui m'écrivit ce billet le 5\\nseptembre. C'était bien le même, à ce qu'il assure, mais il n'osa point\\nlui parler.\\n\\n--Un Anglais! fit Monte-Cristo rêveur et qui s'inquiétait de chaque\\nregard de Julie; un Anglais, dites-vous?\\n\\n--Oui, reprit Maximilien, un Anglais qui se présenta chez nous comme\\nmandataire de la maison Thomson et French, de Rome. Voilà pourquoi,\\nlorsque vous avez dit l'autre jour chez M. de Morcerf que MM. Thomson et\\nFrench étaient vos banquiers, vous m'avez vu tressaillir. Au nom du\\nCiel, monsieur, cela se passait, comme nous vous l'avons dit, en 1829;\\navez-vous connu cet Anglais?\\n\\n--Mais ne m'avez-vous pas dit aussi que la maison Thomson et French\\navait constamment nié vous avoir rendu ce service?\\n\\n--Oui.\\n\\n--Alors cet Anglais ne serait-il pas un homme qui reconnaissant envers\\nvotre père de quelque bonne action qu'il aurait oubliée lui-même,\\naurait pris ce prétexte pour lui rendre un service?\\n\\n--Tout est supposable, monsieur, en pareille circonstance, même un\\nmiracle.\\n\\n--Comment s'appelait-il? demanda Monte-Cristo.\\n\\n--Il n'a laissé d'autre nom, répondit Julie en regardant le comte avec\\nune profonde attention, que le nom qu'il a signé au bas du billet:\\nSimbad le marin.\\n\\n--Ce qui n'est pas un nom évidemment, mais un pseudonyme.»\\n\\nPuis, comme Julie le regardait plus attentivement encore et essayait de\\nsaisir au vol et de rassembler quelques notes de sa voix:\\n\\n«Voyons, continua-t-il, n'est-ce point un homme de ma taille à peu près,\\nun peu plus grand peut-être, un peu plus mince, emprisonné dans une\\nhaute cravate, boutonné, corseté, sanglé et toujours le crayon à la\\nmain?\\n\\n--Oh! mais vous le connaissez donc? s'écria Julie les yeux étincelants\\nde joie.\\n\\n--Non, dit Monte-Cristo, je suppose seulement. J'ai connu un Lord\\nWilmore qui semait ainsi des traits de générosité.\\n\\n--Sans se faire connaître!\\n\\n--C'était un homme bizarre qui ne croyait pas à la reconnaissance.\\n\\n--Oh! s'écria Julie avec un accent sublime et en joignant les mains, à\\nquoi croit-il donc, le malheureux!\\n\\n--Il n'y croyait pas, du moins à l'époque où je l'ai connu, dit\\nMonte-Cristo, que cette voix partie du fond de l'âme avait remué jusqu'à\\nla dernière fibre; mais depuis ce temps peut-être a-t-il eu quelque\\npreuve que la reconnaissance existait.\\n\\n--Et vous connaissez cet homme, monsieur? demanda Emmanuel.\\n\\n--Oh! si vous le connaissez, monsieur, s'écria Julie, dites, dites,\\npouvez-vous nous mener à lui, nous le montrer, nous dire où il est? Dis\\ndonc, Maximilien, dis donc, Emmanuel, si nous le retrouvions jamais, il\\nfaudrait bien qu'il crût à la mémoire du coeur.»\\n\\nMonte-Cristo sentit deux larmes rouler dans ses yeux; il fit encore\\nquelques pas dans le salon.\\n\\n«Au nom du Ciel! monsieur, dit Maximilien, si vous savez quelque chose\\nde cet homme, dites-nous ce que vous en savez!\\n\\n--Hélas! dit Monte-Cristo en comprimant l'émotion de sa voix, si c'est\\nLord Wilmore votre bienfaiteur, je crains bien que jamais vous ne le\\nretrouviez. Je l'ai quitté il y a deux ou trois ans à Palerme et il\\npartait pour les pays les plus fabuleux; si bien que je doute fort qu'il\\nen revienne jamais.\\n\\n--Ah! monsieur, vous êtes cruel!» s'écria Julie avec effroi.\\n\\nEt les larmes vinrent aux yeux de la jeune femme.\\n\\n«Madame, dit gravement Monte-Cristo en dévorant du regard les deux\\nperles liquides qui roulaient sur les joues de Julie, si Lord Wilmore\\navait vu ce que je viens de voir ici, il aimerait encore la vie, car les\\nlarmes que vous versez le raccommoderaient avec le genre humain.»\\n\\nEt il tendit la main à Julie, qui lui donna la sienne, entraînée\\nqu'elle se trouvait par le regard et par l'accent du comte.\\n\\n«Mais ce Lord Wilmore, dit-elle, se rattachant à une dernière espérance,\\nil avait un pays, une famille, des parents, il était connu enfin? Est-ce\\nque nous ne pourrions pas...?\\n\\n--Oh! ne cherchez point, madame, dit le comte, ne bâtissez point de\\ndouces chimères sur cette parole que j'ai laissé échapper. Non, Lord\\nWilmore n'est probablement pas l'homme que vous cherchez: il était mon\\nami, je connaissais tous ses secrets, il m'eût raconté celui-là.\\n\\n--Et il ne vous en a rien dit? s'écria Julie.\\n\\n--Rien.\\n\\n--Jamais un mot qui pût vous faire supposer?...\\n\\n--Jamais.\\n\\n--Cependant vous l'avez nommé tout de suite.\\n\\n--Ah! vous savez... en pareil cas, on suppose.\\n\\n--Ma soeur, ma soeur, dit Maximilien venant en aide au comte, monsieur a\\nraison. Rappelle-toi ce que nous a dit si souvent notre bon père: «Ce\\nn'est pas un Anglais qui nous a fait ce bonheur.»\\n\\nMonte-Cristo tressaillit.\\n\\n«Votre père vous disait... monsieur Morrel?... reprit-il vivement.\\n\\n--Mon père, monsieur, voyait dans cette action un miracle. Mon père\\ncroyait à un bienfaiteur sorti pour nous de la tombe. Oh! la touchante\\nsuperstition, monsieur, que celle-là, et comme, tout en n'y croyant pas\\nmoi-même, j'étais loin de vouloir détruire cette croyance dans son noble\\ncoeur! Aussi combien de fois y rêva-t-il en prononçant tout bas un nom\\nd'ami bien cher, un nom d'ami perdu; et lorsqu'il fut près de mourir,\\nlorsque l'approche de l'éternité eût donné à son esprit quelque chose de\\nl'illumination de la tombe, cette pensée, qui n'avait jusque-là été\\nqu'un doute, devint une conviction, et les dernières paroles qu'il\\nprononça en mourant furent celles-ci: «Maximilien, c'était Edmond\\nDantès!»\\n\\nLa pâleur du comte, qui depuis quelques secondes allait croissant,\\ndevint effrayante à ces paroles. Tout son sang venait d'affluer au\\ncoeur, il ne pouvait parler, il tira sa montre comme s'il eût oublié\\nl'heure, prit son chapeau, présenta à Mme Herbault un compliment brusque\\net embarrassé, et serrant les mains d'Emmanuel et de Maximilien:\\n\\n«Madame, dit-il, permettez-moi de venir quelque fois vous rendre mes\\ndevoirs. J'aime votre maison, et je vous suis reconnaissant de votre\\naccueil, car voici la première fois que je me suis oublié depuis bien\\ndes années.»\\n\\nEt il sortit à grands pas.\\n\\n«C'est un homme singulier que ce comte de Monte-Cristo, dit Emmanuel.\\n\\n--Oui, répondit Maximilien, mais je crois qu'il a un coeur excellent, et\\nje suis sûr qu'il nous aime.\\n\\n--Et moi! dit Julie, sa voix m'a été au coeur, et deux ou trois fois il\\nm'a semblé que ce n'était pas la première fois que je l'entendais.»\",\n",
       " 'LI': \"Aux deux tiers du faubourg Saint-Honoré, derrière un bel hôtel,\\nremarquable entre les remarquables habitations de ce riche quartier,\\ns'étend un vaste jardin dont les marronniers touffus dépassent les\\nénormes murailles, hautes comme des remparts, et laissent, quand vient\\nle printemps, tomber leurs fleurs roses et blanches dans deux vases de\\npierre cannelée placés parallèlement sur deux pilastres quadrangulaires\\ndans lesquels s'enchâsse une grille de fer du temps de Louis XIII.\\n\\nCette entrée grandiose est condamnée, malgré les magnifiques géraniums\\nqui poussent dans les deux vases et qui balancent au vent leurs feuilles\\nmarbrées et leurs fleurs de pourpre, depuis que les propriétaires de\\nl'hôtel, et cela date de longtemps déjà, se sont restreints à la\\npossession de l'hôtel, de la cour plantée d'arbres qui donne sur le\\nfaubourg, et du jardin que ferme cette grille, laquelle donnait\\nautrefois sur un magnifique potager d'un arpent annexé à la propriété.\\nMais le démon de la spéculation ayant tiré une ligne, c'est-à-dire une\\nrue à l'extrémité de ce potager, et la rue, avant d'exister, ayant déjà\\ngrâce à une plaque de fer bruni, reçu un nom, on pensa pouvoir vendre ce\\npotager pour bâtir sur la rue, et faire concurrence à cette grande\\nartère de Paris qu'on appelle le faubourg Saint-Honoré.\\n\\nMais, en matière de spéculation, l'homme propose et l'argent dispose; la\\nrue baptisée mourut au berceau; l'acquéreur du potager, après l'avoir\\nparfaitement payé, ne put trouver à le revendre la somme qu'il en\\nvoulait, et, en attendant une hausse de prix, qui ne peut manquer, un\\njour ou l'autre, de l'indemniser bien au-delà de ses pertes passées et\\nde son capital au repos, il se contenta de louer cet enclos à des\\nmaraîchers, moyennant la somme de cinq cent francs par an.\\n\\nC'est de l'argent placé à un demi pour cent, ce qui n'est pas cher par\\nle temps qui court, où il y a tant de gens qui le placent à cinquante,\\net qui trouvent encore que l'argent est d'un bien pauvre rapport.\\n\\nNéanmoins, comme nous l'avons dit, la grille du jardin, qui autrefois\\ndonnait sur le potager, est condamnée, et la rouille ronge ses gonds; il\\ny a même plus: pour que d'ignobles maraîchers ne souillent pas de leurs\\nregards vulgaires l'intérieur de l'enclos aristocratique, une cloison\\nde planches est appliquée aux barreaux jusqu'à la hauteur de six pieds.\\nIl est vrai que les planches ne sont pas si bien jointes qu'on ne puisse\\nglisser un regard furtif entre les intervalles; mais cette maison est\\nune maison sévère, et qui ne craint point les indiscrétions.\\n\\nDans ce potager, au lieu de choux, de carottes, de radis, de pois et de\\nmelons, poussent de grandes luzernes, seule culture qui annonce que l'on\\nsonge encore à ce lieu abandonné. Une petite porte basse, s'ouvrant sur\\nla rue projetée, donne entrée en ce terrain clos de murs, que ses\\nlocataires viennent d'abandonner à cause de sa stérilité et qui, depuis\\nhuit jours, au lieu de rapporter un demi pour cent, qui comme par le\\npassé, ne rapporte plus rien du tout.\\n\\nDu côté de l'hôtel, les marronniers dont nous avons parlé couronnent la\\nmuraille, ce qui n'empêche pas d'autres arbres luxuriants et fleuris de\\nglisser dans leurs intervalles leurs branches avides d'air. À un angle\\noù le feuillage devient tellement touffu qu'à peine si la lumière y\\npénètre, un large banc de pierre et des sièges de jardin indiquent un\\nlieu de réunion ou une retraite favorite à quelque habitant de l'hôtel\\nsitué à cent pas, et que l'on aperçoit à peine à travers le rempart de\\nverdure qui l'enveloppe. Enfin, le choix de cet asile mystérieux est à\\nla fois justifié par l'absence du soleil, par la fraîcheur éternelle\\nmême pendant les jours les plus brûlants de l'été, par le gazouillement\\ndes oiseaux et par l'éloignement de la maison et de la rue, c'est-à-dire\\ndes affaires et du bruit.\\n\\nVers le soir d'une des plus chaudes journées que le printemps eût\\nencore accordées aux habitants de Paris, il y avait sur ce banc de\\npierre un livre, une ombrelle, un panier à ouvrage et un mouchoir de\\nbatiste dont la broderie était commencée; et non loin de ce banc, près\\nde la grille, debout devant les planches, l'oeil appliqué à la cloison à\\nclaire-voie, une jeune femme, dont le regard plongeait par une fente\\ndans le jardin désert que nous connaissons.\\n\\nPresque au même moment, la petite porte de ce terrain se refermait sans\\nbruit, et un jeune homme, grand, vigoureux, vêtu d'une blouse de toile\\nécrue, d'une casquette de velours, mais dont les moustaches, la barbe et\\nles cheveux noirs extrêmement soignés juraient quelque peu avec ce\\ncostume populaire, après un rapide coup d'oeil jeté autour de lui pour\\ns'assurer que personne ne l'épiait, passant par cette porte, qu'il\\nreferma derrière lui, se dirigeait d'un pas précipité vers la grille.\\n\\nÀ la vue de celui qu'elle attendait, mais non pas probablement sous ce\\ncostume, la jeune fille eut peur et se rejeta en arrière.\\n\\nEt cependant déjà, à travers les fentes de la porte, le jeune homme,\\navec ce regard qui n'appartient qu'aux amants, avait vu flotter la robe\\nblanche et la longue ceinture bleue. Il s'élança vers la cloison, et\\nappliquant sa bouche à une ouverture:\\n\\n«N'ayez pas peur, Valentine, dit-il, c'est moi.»\\n\\nLa jeune fille s'approcha.\\n\\n«Oh! monsieur, dit-elle, pourquoi donc êtes-vous venu si tard\\naujourd'hui? Savez-vous que l'on va dîner bientôt, et qu'il m'a fallu\\nbien de la diplomatie et bien de la promptitude pour me débarrasser de\\nma belle-mère, qui m'épie, de ma femme de chambre qui m'espionne, et de\\nmon frère qui me tourmente pour venir travailler ici à cette broderie,\\nqui, j'en ai bien peur, ne sera pas finie de longtemps? Puis, quand vous\\nvous serez excusé sur votre retard, vous me direz quel est ce nouveau\\ncostume qu'il vous a plu d'adopter et qui presque a été cause que je ne\\nvous ai pas reconnu.\\n\\n--Chère Valentine, dit le jeune homme, vous êtes trop au-dessus de mon\\namour pour que j'ose vous en parler, et cependant, toutes les fois que\\nje vous vois, j'ai besoin de vous dire que je vous adore, afin que\\nl'écho de mes propres paroles me caresse doucement le coeur lorsque je\\nne vous vois plus. Maintenant je vous remercie de votre gronderie: elle\\nest toute charmante, car elle me prouve, je n'ose pas dire que vous\\nm'attendiez, mais que vous pensiez à moi. Vous vouliez savoir la cause\\nde mon retard et le motif de mon déguisement; je vais vous les dire, et\\nj'espère que vous les excuserez: j'ai fait choix d'un état....\\n\\n--D'un état!... Que voulez-vous dire, Maximilien? Et sommes-nous donc\\nassez heureux pour que vous parliez de ce qui nous regarde en\\nplaisantant?\\n\\n--Oh! Dieu me préserve, dit le jeune homme, de plaisanter avec ce qui\\nest ma vie; mais fatigué d'être un coureur de champs et un escaladeur\\nde murailles, sérieusement effrayé de l'idée que vous me fîtes naître\\nl'autre soir que votre père me ferait juger un jour comme voleur, ce qui\\ncompromettrait l'honneur de l'armée française tout entière, non moins\\neffrayé de la possibilité que l'on s'étonne de voir éternellement\\ntourner autour de ce terrain, où il n'y a pas la plus petite citadelle à\\nassiéger ou le plus petit blockhaus à défendre, un capitaine de spahis,\\nje me suis fait maraîcher, et j'ai adopté le costume de ma profession.\\n\\n--Bon, quelle folie!\\n\\n--C'est au contraire la chose la plus sage, je crois, que j'aie faite de\\nma vie, car elle nous donne toute sécurité.\\n\\n--Voyons, expliquez-vous.\\n\\n--Eh bien, j'ai été trouver le propriétaire de cet enclos; le bail avec\\nles anciens locataires était fini, et je le lui ai loué à nouveau. Toute\\ncette luzerne que vous voyez m'appartient, Valentine; rien ne m'empêche\\nde me faire bâtir une cabane dans les foins et de vivre désormais à\\nvingt pas de vous. Oh! ma joie et mon bonheur, je ne puis les contenir.\\nComprenez-vous, Valentine, que l'on parvienne à payer ces choses-là?\\nC'est impossible, n'est-ce pas? Eh bien, toute cette félicité, tout ce\\nbonheur, toute cette joie, pour lesquels j'eusse donné dix ans de ma\\nvie, me coûtent, devinez combien?... Cinq cents francs par an, payables\\npar trimestre. Ainsi, vous le voyez, désormais plus rien à craindre. Je\\nsuis ici chez moi, je puis mettre des échelles contre mon mur et\\nregarder par-dessus, et j'ai, sans crainte qu'une patrouille vienne me\\ndéranger, le droit de vous dire que je vous aime, tant que votre fierté\\nne se blessera pas d'entendre sortir ce mot de la bouche d'un pauvre\\njournalier vêtu d'une blouse et coiffé d'une casquette.»\\n\\nValentine poussa un petit cri de surprise joyeuse; puis tout à coup:\\n\\n«Hélas, Maximilien, dit-elle tristement et comme si un nuage jaloux\\nétait soudain venu voiler le rayon de soleil qui illuminait son coeur,\\nmaintenant nous serons trop libres, notre bonheur nous fera tenter Dieu;\\nnous abuserons de notre sécurité, et notre sécurité nous perdra.\\n\\n--Pouvez-vous me dire cela, mon amie, à moi qui, depuis que je vous\\nconnais, vous prouve chaque jour que j'ai subordonné mes pensées et ma\\nvie à votre vie et à vos pensées? Qui vous a donné confiance en moi? mon\\nbonheur, n'est-ce pas? Quand vous m'avez dit qu'un vague instinct vous\\nassurait que vous couriez quelque grand danger, j'ai mis mon dévouement\\nà votre service, sans vous demander d'autre récompense que le bonheur de\\nvous servir. Depuis ce temps, vous ai-je, par un mot, par un signe,\\ndonné l'occasion de vous repentir de m'avoir distingué au milieu de ceux\\nqui eussent été heureux de mourir pour vous? Vous m'avez dit, pauvre\\nenfant, que vous étiez fiancée à M. d'Épinay, que votre père avait\\ndécidé cette alliance, c'est-à-dire qu'elle était certaine, car tout ce\\nque veut M. de Villefort arrive infailliblement. Eh bien, je suis resté\\ndans l'ombre, attendant tout, non pas de ma volonté, non pas de la\\nvôtre, mais des événements, de la Providence, de Dieu, et cependant\\nvous m'aimez, vous avez eu pitié de moi, Valentine, et vous me l'avez\\ndit; merci pour cette douce parole que je ne vous demande que de me\\nrépéter de temps en temps, et qui me fera tout oublier.\\n\\n--Et voilà ce qui vous a enhardi, Maximilien, voilà ce qui me fait à la\\nfois une vie bien douce et bien malheureuse, au point que je me demande\\nsouvent lequel vaut mieux pour moi, du chagrin que me causait autrefois\\nla rigueur de ma belle-mère et sa préférence aveugle pour son enfant, ou\\ndu bonheur plein de dangers que je goûte en vous voyant.\\n\\n--Du danger! s'écria Maximilien; pouvez-vous dire un mot si dur et si\\ninjuste? Avez-vous jamais vu un esclave plus soumis que moi? Vous m'avez\\npermis de vous adresser quelquefois la parole, Valentine, mais vous\\nm'avez défendu de vous suivre; j'ai obéi. Depuis que j'ai trouvé le\\nmoyen de me glisser dans cet enclos, de causer avec vous à travers cette\\nporte, d'être enfin si près de vous sans vous voir, ai-je jamais,\\ndites-le-moi, demandé à toucher le bas de votre robe à travers ces\\ngrilles? Ai-je jamais fait un pas pour franchir ce mur, ridicule\\nobstacle pour ma jeunesse et ma force? Jamais un reproche sur votre\\nrigueur, jamais un désir exprimé tout haut; j'ai été rivé à ma parole\\ncomme un chevalier des temps passés. Avouez cela du moins, pour que je\\nne vous croie pas injuste.\\n\\n--C'est vrai, dit Valentine, en passant entre deux planches le bout d'un\\nde ses doigts effilés sur lequel Maximilien posa ses lèvres; c'est vrai,\\nvous êtes un honnête ami. Mais enfin vous n'avez agi qu'avec le\\nsentiment de votre intérêt, mon cher Maximilien; vous saviez bien que,\\ndu jour où l'esclave deviendrait exigeant, il lui faudrait tout perdre.\\nVous m'avez promis l'amitié d'un frère, à moi qui n'ai pas d'amis, à moi\\nque mon père oublie, à moi que ma belle-mère persécute, et qui n'ai pour\\nconsolation que le vieillard immobile, muet, glacé, dont la main ne peut\\nserrer ma main, dont l'oeil seul peut me parler, et dont le coeur bat\\nsans doute pour moi d'un reste de chaleur. Dérision amère du sort qui me\\nfait ennemie et victime de tous ceux qui sont plus forts que moi, et qui\\nme donne un cadavre pour soutien et pour ami! Oh! vraiment, Maximilien,\\nje vous le répète, je suis bien malheureuse, et vous avez raison de\\nm'aimer pour moi et non pour vous.\\n\\n--Valentine, dit le jeune homme avec une émotion profonde, je ne dirai\\npas que je n'aime que vous au monde, car j'aime aussi ma soeur et mon\\nbeau-frère, mais c'est d'un amour doux et calme, qui ne ressemble en\\nrien au sentiment que j'éprouve pour vous: quand je pense à vous, mon\\nsang bout, ma poitrine se gonfle, mon coeur déborde; mais cette force,\\ncette ardeur, cette puissance surhumaine, je les emploierai à vous aimer\\nseulement jusqu'au jour où vous me direz de les employer à vous servir.\\nM. Franz d'Épinay sera absent un an encore, dit-on; en un an, que de\\nchances favorables peuvent nous servir, que d'événements peuvent nous\\nseconder! Espérons donc toujours, c'est si bon et si doux d'espérer!\\nMais en attendant, vous, Valentine, vous qui me reprochez mon égoïsme,\\nqu'avez-vous été pour moi? La belle et froide statue de la Vénus\\npudique. En échange de ce dévouement, de cette obéissance, de cette\\nretenue, que m'avez-vous promis, vous? rien; que m'avez-vous accordé?\\nbien peu de chose. Vous me parlez de M. d'Épinay, votre fiancé, et vous\\nsoupirez à cette idée d'être un jour à lui. Voyons, Valentine, est-ce là\\ntout ce que vous avez dans l'âme? Quoi! je vous engage ma vie, je vous\\ndonne mon âme, je vous consacre jusqu'au plus insignifiant battement de\\nmon coeur, et quand je suis tout à vous, moi, quand je me dis tout bas\\nque je mourrai si je vous perds, vous ne vous épouvantez pas, vous, à la\\nseule idée d'appartenir à un autre! Oh! Valentine! Valentine, si j'étais\\nce que vous êtes, si je me sentais aimé comme vous êtes sûre que je vous\\naime, déjà cent fois j'eusse passé ma main entre les barreaux de cette\\ngrille, et j'eusse serré la main du pauvre Maximilien en lui disant: «À\\nvous, à vous seul, Maximilien, dans ce monde et dans l'autre.»\\n\\nValentine ne répondit rien, mais le jeune homme l'entendit soupirer et\\npleurer.\\n\\nLa réaction fut prompte sur Maximilien.\\n\\n«Oh! s'écria-t-il, Valentine! Valentine! oubliez mes paroles, s'il y a\\ndans mes paroles quelque chose qui ait pu vous blesser!\\n\\n--Non, dit-elle, vous avez raison; mais ne voyez-vous pas que je suis\\nune pauvre créature, abandonnée dans une maison presque étrangère, car\\nmon père m'est presque un étranger, et dont la volonté a été brisée\\ndepuis dix ans, jour par jour, heure par heure, minute par minute, par\\nla volonté de fer des maîtres qui pèsent sur moi? Personne ne voit ce\\nque je souffre et je ne l'ai dit à personne qu'à vous. En apparence, et\\naux yeux de tout le monde, tout m'est bon, tout m'est affectueux; en\\nréalité, tout m'est hostile. Le monde dit: «M. de Villefort est trop\\ngrave et trop sévère pour être bien tendre envers sa fille; mais elle a\\neu du moins le bonheur de retrouver dans Mme de Villefort une seconde\\nmère.» Eh bien, le monde se trompe, mon père m'abandonne avec\\nindifférence, et ma belle-mère me hait avec un acharnement d'autant plus\\nterrible qu'il est voilé par un éternel sourire.\\n\\n--Vous haïr! vous, Valentine! et comment peut-on vous haïr?\\n\\n--Hélas! mon ami, dit Valentine, je suis forcée d'avouer que cette haine\\npour moi vient d'un sentiment presque naturel. Elle adore son fils, mon\\nfrère Édouard.\\n\\n--Eh bien?\\n\\n--Eh bien, cela me semble étrange de mêler à ce que nous disions une\\nquestion d'argent, eh! bien, mon ami, je crois que sa haine vient de là\\ndu moins. Comme elle n'a pas de fortune de son côté, que moi je suis\\ndéjà riche du chef de ma mère, et que cette fortune sera encore plus que\\ndoublée par celle de M. et de Mme de Saint-Méran, qui doit me revenir un\\njour, eh bien, je crois qu'elle est envieuse. Oh! mon Dieu! si je\\npouvais lui donner la moitié de cette fortune et me retrouver chez M. de\\nVillefort comme une fille dans la maison de son père, certes je le\\nferais à l'instant même.\\n\\n--Pauvre Valentine!\\n\\n--Oui, je me sens enchaînée, et en même temps je me sens si faible,\\nqu'il me semble que ces liens me soutiennent, et que j'ai peur de les\\nrompre. D'ailleurs, mon père n'est pas un homme dont on puisse\\nenfreindre impunément les ordres: il est puissant contre moi, il le\\nserait contre vous, il le serait contre le roi lui-même, protégé qu'il\\nest par un irréprochable passé et par une position presque inattaquable.\\nOh! Maximilien! je vous le jure, je ne lutte pas, parce que c'est vous\\nautant que moi que je crains de briser dans cette lutte.\\n\\n--Mais enfin, Valentine, reprit Maximilien, pourquoi désespérer ainsi,\\net voir l'avenir toujours sombre?\\n\\n--Ah! mon ami, parce que je le juge par le passé.\\n\\n--Voyons cependant, si je ne suis pas un parti illustre au point de vue\\naristocratique, je tiens cependant, par beaucoup de points, au monde\\ndans lequel vous vivez; le temps où il y avait deux Frances dans la\\nFrance n'existe plus; les plus hautes familles de la monarchie se sont\\nfondues dans les familles de l'Empire: l'aristocratie de la lance a\\népousé la noblesse du canon. Eh bien, moi, j'appartiens à cette\\ndernière: j'ai un bel avenir dans l'armée, je jouis d'une fortune\\nbornée, mais indépendante; la mémoire de mon père, enfin, est vénérée\\ndans notre pays comme celle d'un des plus honnêtes négociants qui aient\\nexisté. Je dis notre pays, Valentine, parce que vous êtes presque de\\nMarseille.\\n\\n--Ne me parlez pas de Marseille, Maximilien, ce seul mot me rappelle ma\\nbonne mère, cet ange que tout le monde a regretté, et qui, après avoir\\nveillé sur sa fille pendant son court séjour sur la terre, veille encore\\nsur elle, je l'espère du moins, pendant son éternel séjour au ciel. Oh!\\nsi ma pauvre mère vivait, Maximilien, je n'aurais plus rien à craindre;\\nje lui dirais que je vous aime, et elle nous protégerait.\\n\\n--Hélas! Valentine, reprit Maximilien, si elle vivait, je ne vous\\nconnaîtrais pas sans doute, car, vous l'avez dit, vous seriez heureuse\\nsi elle vivait, et Valentine heureuse m'eût regardé bien dédaigneusement\\ndu haut de sa grandeur.\\n\\n--Ah! mon ami, s'écria Valentine, c'est vous qui êtes injuste à votre\\ntour.... Mais, dites-moi....\\n\\n--Que voulez-vous que je vous dise? reprit Maximilien, voyant que\\nValentine hésitait.\\n\\n--Dites-moi, continua la jeune fille, est-ce qu'autrefois à Marseille il\\ny a eu quelque sujet de mésintelligence entre votre père et le mien?\\n\\n--Non, pas que je sache, répondit Maximilien, ce n'est que votre père\\nétait un partisan plus que zélé des Bourbons, et le mien un homme dévoué\\nà l'Empereur. C'est, je le présume, tout ce qu'il y a jamais eu de\\ndissidence entre eux. Mais pourquoi cette question, Valentine?\\n\\n--Je vais vous le dire, reprit la jeune fille, car vous devez tout\\nsavoir. Eh bien, c'était le jour où votre nomination d'officier de la\\nLégion d'honneur fut publiée dans le journal. Nous étions tous chez mon\\ngrand-père, M. Noirtier, et de plus il y avait encore M. Danglars, vous\\nsavez ce banquier dont les chevaux ont avant-hier failli tuer ma mère et\\nmon frère? Je lisais le journal tout haut à mon grand-père pendant que\\nces messieurs causaient du mariage de mademoiselle Danglars. Lorsque\\nj'en vins au paragraphe qui vous concernait et que j'avais déjà lu, car\\ndès la veille au matin vous m'aviez annoncé cette bonne nouvelle;\\nlorsque j'en vins, dis-je, au paragraphe qui vous concernait, j'étais\\nbien heureuse... mais aussi bien tremblante d'être forcée de prononcer\\ntout haut votre nom et certainement je l'eusse omis sans la crainte que\\nj'éprouvais qu'on interprétât mal mon silence; donc je rassemblai tout\\nmon courage, et je lus.\\n\\n--Chère Valentine!\\n\\n--Eh bien, aussitôt que résonna votre nom, mon père tourna la tête.\\nJ'étais si persuadée (voyez comme je suis folle!) que tout le monde\\nallait être frappé de ce nom comme d'un coup de foudre, que je crus voir\\ntressaillir mon père et même (pour celui-là c'était une illusion, j'en\\nsuis sûre), et même M. Danglars.\\n\\n«--Morrel, dit mon père, attendez donc!» (Il fronça le sourcil.)\\n«Serait-ce un de ces Morrel de Marseille, un de ces enragés\\nbonapartistes qui nous ont donné tant de mal en 1815?\\n\\n«--Oui, répondit M. Danglars; je crois même que c'est le fils de\\nl'ancien armateur.»\\n\\n--Vraiment! fit Maximilien. Et que répondit votre père, dites,\\nValentine?\\n\\n--Oh! une chose affreuse et que je n'ose vous redire.\\n\\n--Dites toujours, reprit Maximilien en souriant.\\n\\n«--Leur Empereur, continua-t-il en fronçant le sourcil, savait les\\nmettre à leur place, tous ces fanatiques: il les appelait de la chair à\\ncanon, et c'était le seul nom qu'ils méritassent. Je vois avec joie que\\nle gouvernement nouveau remet en vigueur ce salutaire principe. Quand ce\\nne serait que pour cela qu'il garde l'Algérie, j'en féliciterais le\\ngouvernement, quoiqu'elle nous coûte un peu cher.\\n\\n--C'est en effet d'une politique assez brutale, dit Maximilien. Mais ne\\nrougissez point, chère amie, de ce qu'a dit là M. de Villefort; mon\\nbrave père ne cédait en rien au vôtre sur ce point, et il répétait sans\\ncesse: «Pourquoi donc l'Empereur, qui fait tant de belles choses, ne\\nfait-il pas un régiment de juges et d'avocats, et ne les envoie-t-il pas\\ntoujours au premier feu?» Vous le voyez, chère amie, les partis se\\nvalent pour le pittoresque de l'expression et pour la douceur de la\\npensée. Mais M. Danglars, que dit-il à cette sortie du procureur du roi?\\n\\n--Oh! lui se mit à rire de ce rire sournois qui lui est particulier et\\nque je trouve féroce; puis ils se levèrent l'instant d'après et\\npartirent. Je vis alors seulement que mon grand-père était tout agité.\\nIl faut vous dire, Maximilien, que, moi seule, je devine ses agitations,\\nà ce pauvre paralytique, et je me doutais d'ailleurs que la\\nconversation qui avait eu lieu devant lui (car on ne fait plus attention\\nà lui, pauvre grand-père!) l'avait fort impressionné, attendu qu'on\\navait dit du mal de son Empereur, et que, à ce qu'il paraît, il a été\\nfanatique de l'Empereur.\\n\\n--C'est, en effet, dit Maximilien, un des noms connus de l'empire: il a\\nété sénateur, et, comme vous le savez ou comme vous ne le savez pas,\\nValentine, il fut près de toutes les conspirations bonapartistes que\\nl'on fit sous la Restauration.\\n\\n--Oui, j'entends quelquefois dire tout bas de ces choses-là qui me\\nsemblent étranges: le grand-père bonapartiste, le père royaliste; enfin,\\nque voulez-vous?... Je me retournai donc vers lui. Il me montrait le\\njournal du regard.\\n\\n«--Qu'avez-vous, papa? lui dis-je; êtes-vous content?»\\n\\nIl me fit de la tête signe que oui.\\n\\n«--De ce que mon père vient de dire? demandai-je.»\\n\\nIl fit signe que non.\\n\\n«--De ce que M. Danglars a dit?»\\n\\nIl fit signe que non encore.\\n\\n«--C'est donc de ce que M. Morrel, je n'osai pas dire Maximilien, est\\nnommé officier de la Légion d'honneur?»\\n\\nIl fit signe que oui.\\n\\n--Le croiriez-vous, Maximilien? il était content que vous fussiez nommé\\nofficier de la Légion d'honneur, lui qui ne vous connaît pas. C'est\\npeut-être de la folie de sa part, car il tourne, dit-on, à l'enfance:\\nmais je l'aime bien pour ce oui-là.\\n\\n--C'est bizarre, pensa Maximilien. Votre père me haïrait donc, tandis\\nqu'au contraire votre grand-père... Étranges choses que ces amours et\\nces haines de parti!\\n\\n--Chut! s'écria tout à coup Valentine. Cachez-vous, sauvez-vous; on\\nvient!»\\n\\nMaximilien sauta sur une bêche et se mit à retourner impitoyablement la\\nluzerne.\\n\\n«Mademoiselle! Mademoiselle! cria une voix derrière les arbres, Mme de\\nVillefort vous cherche partout et vous appelle; il y a une visite au\\nsalon.\\n\\n--Une visite! dit Valentine tout agitée; et qui nous fait cette visite?\\n\\n--Un grand seigneur, un prince, à ce qu'on dit, M. le comte de\\nMonte-Cristo.\\n\\n--J'y vais», dit tout haut Valentine.\\n\\nCe nom fit tressaillir de l'autre côté de la grille celui à qui le _j'y\\nvais_ de Valentine servait d'adieu à la fin de chaque entrevue.\\n\\n«Tiens! se dit Maximilien en s'appuyant tout pensif sur sa bêche,\\ncomment le comte de Monte-Cristo connaît-il M. de Villefort?»\",\n",
       " 'LII': \"C'était bien réellement M. le comte de Monte-Cristo qui venait d'entrer\\nchez Mme de Villefort, dans l'intention de rendre à M. le procureur du\\nroi la visite qu'il lui avait faite, et à ce nom toute la maison, comme\\non le comprend bien, avait été mise en émoi.\\n\\nMme de Villefort, qui était au salon lorsqu'on annonça le comte, fit\\naussitôt venir son fils pour que l'enfant réitérât ses remerciements au\\ncomte, et Édouard, qui n'avait cessé d'entendre parler depuis deux jours\\ndu grand personnage, se hâta d'accourir, non par obéissance pour sa\\nmère, non pour remercier le comte, mais par curiosité et pour faire\\nquelque remarque à l'aide de laquelle il pût placer un de ces lazzis\\nqui faisaient dire à sa mère: «Ô le méchant enfant! Mais il faut bien\\nque je lui pardonne, il a tant d'esprit!»\\n\\nAprès les premières politesses d'usage, le comte s'informa de M. de\\nVillefort.\\n\\n«Mon mari dîne chez M. le Chancelier, répondit la jeune femme; il vient\\nde partir à l'instant même, et il regrettera bien, j'en suis sûre,\\nd'avoir été privé du bonheur de vous voir.»\\n\\nDeux visiteurs qui avaient précédé le comte dans le salon, et qui le\\ndévoraient des yeux se retirèrent après le temps raisonnable exigé à la\\nfois par la politesse et par la curiosité.\\n\\n«À propos, que fait donc ta soeur Valentine? dit Mme de Villefort à\\nÉdouard; qu'on la prévienne afin que j'aie l'honneur de la présenter à\\nM. le comte.\\n\\n--Vous avez une fille, madame? demanda le comte, mais ce doit être une\\nenfant?\\n\\n--C'est la fille de M. de Villefort, répliqua la jeune femme; une fille\\nd'un premier mariage, une grande et belle personne.\\n\\n--Mais mélancolique», interrompit le jeune Édouard en arrachant, pour en\\nfaire une aigrette à son chapeau, les plumes de la queue d'un magnifique\\nara qui criait de douleur sur son perchoir doré.\\n\\nMme de Villefort se contenta de dire:\\n\\n«Silence, Édouard!\\n\\n«Ce jeune étourdi a presque raison, et répète là ce qu'il m'a bien des\\nfois entendue dire avec douleur car Mlle de Villefort est, malgré tout\\nce que nous pouvons faire pour la distraire, d'un caractère triste et\\nd'une humeur taciturne qui nuisent souvent à l'effet de sa beauté. Mais\\nelle ne vient pas; Édouard, voyez donc pourquoi cela.\\n\\n--Parce qu'on la cherche où elle n'est pas.\\n\\n--Où la cherche-t-on?\\n\\n--Chez grand-papa Noirtier.\\n\\n--Et elle n'est pas là, vous croyez?\\n\\n--Non, non, non, non, non, elle n'y est pas, répondit Édouard en\\nchantonnant.\\n\\n--Et où est-elle? Si vous le savez, dites-le.\\n\\n--Elle est sous le grand marronnier», continua le méchant garçon, en\\nprésentant, malgré les cris de sa mère, des mouches vivantes au\\nperroquet, qui paraissait fort friand de cette sorte de gibier.\\n\\nMme de Villefort étendait la main pour sonner, et pour indiquer à la\\nfemme de chambre le lieu où elle trouverait Valentine, lorsque celle-ci\\nentra. Elle semblait triste, en effet, et en la regardant attentivement\\non eût même pu voir dans ses yeux des traces de larmes.\\n\\nValentine, que nous avons, entraîné par la rapidité du récit, présentée\\nà nos lecteurs sans la faire connaître, était une grande et svelte jeune\\nfille de dix-neuf ans, aux cheveux châtain clair, aux yeux bleu foncé, à\\nla démarche languissante et empreinte de cette exquise distinction qui\\ncaractérisait sa mère; ses mains blanches et effilées, son cou nacré,\\nses joues marbrées de fugitives couleurs, lui donnaient au premier\\naspect l'air d'une de ces belles Anglaises qu'on a comparées assez\\npoétiquement dans leurs allures à des cygnes qui se mirent.\\n\\nElle entra donc, et, voyant près de sa mère l'étranger dont elle avait\\ntant entendu parler déjà, elle salua sans aucune minauderie de jeune\\nfille et sans baisser les yeux, avec une grâce qui redoubla l'attention\\ndu comte.\\n\\nCelui-ci se leva.\\n\\n«Mlle de Villefort, ma belle-fille, dit Mme de Villefort à Monte-Cristo,\\nen se penchant sur son sofa et en montrant de la main Valentine.\\n\\n--Et monsieur le comte de Monte-Cristo, roi de la Chine, empereur de la\\nCochinchine», dit le jeune drôle en lançant un regard sournois à sa\\nsoeur.\\n\\nPour cette fois, Mme de Villefort pâlit, et faillit s'irriter contre ce\\nfléau domestique qui répondait au nom d'Édouard; mais, tout au\\ncontraire, le comte sourit et parut regarder l'enfant avec complaisance,\\nce qui porta au comble la joie et l'enthousiasme de sa mère.\\n\\n«Mais, madame, reprit le comte en renouant la conversation et en\\nregardant tour à tour Mme de Villefort et Valentine, est-ce que je n'ai\\npas déjà eu l'honneur de vous voir quelque part, vous et mademoiselle?\\nTout à l'heure j'y songeais déjà; et quand mademoiselle est entrée, sa\\nvue a été une lueur de plus jetée sur un souvenir confus, pardonnez-moi\\nce mot.\\n\\n--Cela n'est pas probable, monsieur; Mlle de Villefort aime peu le\\nmonde, et nous sortons rarement, dit la jeune femme.\\n\\n--Aussi n'est-ce point dans le monde que j'ai vu mademoiselle, ainsi que\\nvous, madame, ainsi que ce charmant espiègle. Le monde parisien,\\nd'ailleurs, m'est absolument inconnu, car, je crois avoir eu l'honneur\\nde vous le dire, je suis à Paris depuis quelques jours. Non, si vous\\npermettez que je me rappelle... attendez...»\\n\\nLe comte mit sa main sur son front comme pour concentrer tous ses\\nsouvenirs:\\n\\n«Non, c'est au-dehors... c'est... je ne sais pas... mais il me semble\\nque ce souvenir est inséparable d'un beau soleil et d'une espèce de\\nfête religieuse... mademoiselle tenait des fleurs à la main; l'enfant\\ncourait après un beau paon dans un jardin, et vous, madame, vous étiez\\nsous une treille en berceau.... Aidez-moi donc, madame; est-ce que les\\nchoses que je vous dis là ne vous rappellent rien?\\n\\n--Non, en vérité, répondit Mme de Villefort; et cependant il me semble,\\nmonsieur, que si je vous avais rencontré quelque part, votre souvenir\\nserait resté présent à ma mémoire.\\n\\n--Monsieur le comte nous a vus peut-être en Italie, dit timidement\\nValentine.\\n\\n--En effet, en Italie... c'est possible, dit Monte-Cristo. Vous avez\\nvoyagé en Italie, mademoiselle?\\n\\n--Madame et moi, nous y allâmes il y a deux ans. Les médecins\\ncraignaient pour ma poitrine et m'avaient recommandé l'air de Naples.\\nNous passâmes par Bologne, par Pérouse et par Rome.\\n\\n--Ah! c'est vrai, mademoiselle, s'écria Monte-Cristo, comme si cette\\nsimple indication suffisait à fixer tous ses souvenirs. C'est à Pérouse,\\nle jour de la Fête-Dieu, dans le jardin de l'hôtellerie de la Poste, où\\nle hasard nous a réunis, vous, mademoiselle, votre fils et moi, que je\\nme rappelle avoir eu l'honneur de vous voir.\\n\\n--Je me rappelle parfaitement Pérouse, monsieur, et l'hôtellerie de la\\nPoste, et la fête dont vous me parlez, dit Mme de Villefort; mais j'ai\\nbeau interroger mes souvenirs; et, j'ai honte de mon peu de mémoire, je\\nne me souviens pas d'avoir eu l'honneur de vous voir.\\n\\n--C'est étrange, ni moi non plus, dit Valentine en levant ses beaux yeux\\nsur Monte-Cristo.\\n\\n--Ah! moi, je m'en souviens, dit Édouard.\\n\\n--Je vais vous aider, madame, reprit le comte. La journée avait été\\nbrûlante; vous attendiez des chevaux qui n'arrivaient pas à cause de la\\nsolennité. Mademoiselle s'éloigna dans les profondeurs du jardin, et\\nvotre fils disparut, courant après l'oiseau.\\n\\n--Je l'ai attrapé, maman; tu sais, dit Édouard, je lui ai arraché trois\\nplumes de la queue.\\n\\n--Vous, madame, vous demeurâtes sous le berceau de vigne; ne vous\\nsouvient-il plus, pendant que vous étiez assise sur un banc de pierre et\\npendant que, comme je vous l'ai dit, Mlle de Villefort et monsieur votre\\nfils étaient absents, d'avoir causé assez longtemps avec quelqu'un?\\n\\n--Oui vraiment, oui, dit la jeune femme en rougissant, je m'en souviens,\\navec un homme enveloppé d'un long manteau de laine... avec un médecin,\\nje crois.\\n\\n--Justement, madame; cet homme, c'était moi; depuis quinze jours\\nj'habitais dans cette hôtellerie j'avais guéri mon valet de chambre de\\nla fièvre et mon hôte de la jaunisse, de sorte que l'on me regardait\\ncomme un grand docteur. Nous causâmes longtemps, madame, de choses\\ndifférentes, du Pérugin, de Raphaël, des moeurs, des costumes, de cette\\nfameuse aqua-tofana, dont quelques personnes, vous avait-on dit, je\\ncrois, conservaient encore le secret à Pérouse.\\n\\n--Ah! c'est vrai, dit vivement Mme de Villefort avec une certaine\\ninquiétude, je me rappelle.\\n\\n--Je ne sais plus ce que vous me dîtes en détail, madame, reprit le\\ncomte avec une parfaite tranquillité, mais je me souviens parfaitement\\nque, partageant à mon sujet l'erreur générale, vous me consultâtes sur\\nla santé de Mlle de Villefort.\\n\\n--Mais cependant, monsieur, vous étiez bien réellement médecin, dit Mme\\nde Villefort, puisque vous avez guéri des malades.\\n\\n--Molière ou Beaumarchais vous répondraient, madame, que c'est justement\\nparce que je ne l'étais pas que j'ai, non point guéri mes malades, mais\\nque mes malades ont guéri; moi, je me contenterai de vous dire que j'ai\\nassez étudié à fond la chimie et les sciences naturelles, mais en\\namateur seulement... vous comprenez.»\\n\\nEn ce moment six heures sonnèrent.\\n\\n«Voilà six heures, dit Mme de Villefort, visiblement agitée;\\nn'allez-vous pas voir, Valentine, si votre grand-père est prêt à\\ndîner?»\\n\\nValentine se leva, et, saluant le comte, elle sortit de la chambre sans\\nprononcer un mot.\\n\\n«Oh! mon Dieu, madame, serait-ce donc à cause de moi que vous congédiez\\nMlle de Villefort? dit le comte lorsque Valentine fut partie.\\n\\n--Pas le moins du monde, reprit vivement la jeune femme, mais c'est\\nl'heure à laquelle nous faisons faire à M. Noirtier le triste repas qui\\nsoutient sa triste existence. Vous savez, monsieur, dans quel état\\nlamentable est le père de mon mari?\\n\\n--Oui, madame, M. de Villefort m'en a parlé; une paralysie, je crois.\\n\\n--Hélas! oui; il y a chez ce pauvre vieillard absence complète du\\nmouvement, l'âme seule veille dans cette machine humaine, et encore pâle\\net tremblante, et comme une lampe prête à s'éteindre. Mais pardon,\\nmonsieur, de vous entretenir de nos infortunes domestiques, je vous ai\\ninterrompu au moment où vous me disiez que vous étiez un habile\\nchimiste.\\n\\n--Oh! je ne disais pas cela, madame, répondit le comte avec un sourire;\\nbien au contraire, j'ai étudié la chimie parce que, décidé à vivre\\nparticulièrement en Orient, j'ai voulu suivre l'exemple du roi\\nMithridate.\\n\\n--_Mithridates, rex Ponticus_, dit l'étourdi en découpant des\\nsilhouettes dans un magnifique album, le même qui déjeunait tous les\\nmatins avec une tasse de poison à la crème.\\n\\n--Édouard! méchant enfant! s'écria Mme de Villefort en arrachant le\\nlivre mutilé des mains de son fils, vous êtes insupportable, vous nous\\nétourdissez. Laissez-nous, et allez rejoindre votre soeur Valentine chez\\nbon-papa Noirtier.\\n\\n--L'album... dit Édouard.\\n\\n--Comment, l'album?\\n\\n--Oui: je veux l'album....\\n\\n--Pourquoi avez-vous découpé les dessins?\\n\\n--Parce que cela m'amuse.\\n\\n--Allez-vous-en! allez!\\n\\n--Je ne m'en irai pas si l'on ne me donne pas l'album, fit, en\\ns'établissant dans un grand fauteuil, l'enfant, fidèle à son habitude de\\nne jamais céder.\\n\\n--Tenez, et laissez-nous tranquilles», dit Mme de Villefort.\\n\\nEt elle donna l'album à Édouard, qui partit accompagné de sa mère.\\n\\nLe comte suivit des yeux Mme de Villefort.\\n\\n«Voyons si elle fermera la porte derrière lui», murmura-t-il.\\n\\nMme de Villefort ferma la porte avec le plus grand soin derrière\\nl'enfant; le comte ne parut pas s'en apercevoir.\\n\\nPuis, en jetant un dernier regard autour d'elle, la jeune femme revint\\ns'asseoir sur sa causeuse.\\n\\n«Permettez-moi de vous faire observer, madame, dit le comte avec cette\\nbonhomie que nous lui connaissons, que vous êtes bien sévère pour ce\\ncharmant espiègle.\\n\\n--Il le faut bien, monsieur, répliqua Mme de Villefort avec un\\nvéritable aplomb de mère.\\n\\n--C'est son Cornelius Nepos que récitait M. Édouard en parlant du roi\\nMithridate, dit le comte, et vous l'avez interrompu dans une citation\\nqui prouve que son précepteur n'a point perdu son temps avec lui, et que\\nvotre fils est fort avancé pour son âge.\\n\\n--Le fait est, monsieur le comte, répondit la mère flattée doucement,\\nqu'il a une grande facilité et qu'il apprend tout ce qu'il veut. Il n'a\\nqu'un défaut, c'est d'être très volontaire; mais, à propos de ce qu'il\\ndisait, est-ce que vous croyez, par exemple, monsieur le comte, que\\nMithridate usât de ces précautions et que ces précautions pussent être\\nefficaces?\\n\\n--J'y crois si bien, madame, que, moi qui vous parle, j'en ai usé pour\\nne pas être empoisonné à Naples, à Palerme et à Smyrne, c'est-à-dire\\ndans trois occasions où, sans cette précaution, j'aurais pu laisser ma\\nvie.\\n\\n--Et le moyen vous a réussi?\\n\\n--Parfaitement.\\n\\n--Oui, c'est vrai; je me rappelle que vous m'avez déjà raconté quelque\\nchose de pareil à Pérouse.\\n\\n--Vraiment! fit le comte avec une surprise admirablement jouée; je ne me\\nrappelle pas, moi.\\n\\n--Je vous demandais si les poisons agissaient également et avec une\\nsemblable énergie sur les hommes du Nord et sur les hommes du Midi, et\\nvous me répondîtes même que les tempéraments froids et lymphatiques des\\nSeptentrionaux ne présentaient pas la même aptitude que la riche et\\nénergique nature des gens du Midi.\\n\\n--C'est vrai, dit Monte-Cristo; j'ai vu des Russes dévorer, sans être\\nincommodés, des substances végétales qui eussent tué infailliblement un\\nNapolitain ou un Arabe.\\n\\n--Ainsi, vous le croyez, le résultat serait encore plus sûr chez nous\\nqu'en Orient, et au milieu de nos brouillards et de nos pluies, un homme\\ns'habituerait plus facilement que sous une chaude latitude à cette\\nabsorption progressive du poison?\\n\\n--Certainement; bien entendu, toutefois, qu'on ne sera prémuni que\\ncontre le poison auquel on se sera habitué.\\n\\n--Oui, je comprends; et comment vous habitueriez-vous, vous, par\\nexemple, ou plutôt comment vous êtes-vous habitué?\\n\\n--C'est bien facile. Supposez que vous sachiez d'avance de quel poison\\non doit user contre vous.... Supposez que ce poison soit de la...\\nbrucine, exemple....\\n\\n--La brucine se tire de la fausse angusture, je crois, dit Mme de\\nVillefort.\\n\\n--Justement, madame, répondit Monte-Cristo; mais je crois qu'il ne me\\nreste pas grand-chose à vous apprendre; recevez mes compliments: de\\npareilles connaissances sont rares chez les femmes.\\n\\n--Oh! je l'avoue, dit Mme de Villefort, j'ai la plus violente passion\\npour les sciences occultes qui parlent à l'imagination comme une poésie,\\net se résolvent en chiffres comme une équation algébrique; mais\\ncontinuez, je vous prie: ce que vous me dites m'intéresse au plus haut\\npoint.\\n\\n--Eh bien, reprit Monte-Cristo, supposez que ce poison soit de la\\nbrucine, par exemple, et que vous en preniez un milligramme le premier\\njour, deux milligrammes le second, eh bien, au bout de dix jours vous\\naurez un centigramme; au bout de vingt jours, en augmentant d'un autre\\nmilligramme, vous aurez trois centigrammes, c'est-à-dire une dose que\\nvous supporterez sans inconvénient, et qui serait déjà fort dangereuse\\npour une autre personne qui n'aurait pas pris les mêmes précautions que\\nvous; enfin, au bout d'un mois, en buvant de l'eau dans la même carafe,\\nvous tuerez la personne qui aura bu cette eau en même temps que vous,\\nsans vous apercevoir autrement que par un simple malaise qu'il y ait eu\\nune substance vénéneuse quelconque mêlée à cette eau.\\n\\n--Vous ne connaissez pas d'autre contrepoison?\\n\\n--Je n'en connais pas.\\n\\n--J'avais souvent lu et relu cette histoire de Mithridate, dit Mme de\\nVillefort pensive, et je l'avais prise pour une fable.\\n\\n--Non, madame; contre l'habitude de l'histoire, c'est une vérité. Mais\\nce que vous me dites là, madame, ce que vous me demandez n'est point le\\nrésultat d'une question capricieuse, puisqu'il y a deux ans déjà vous\\nm'avez fait des questions pareilles, et que vous me dites que depuis\\nlongtemps cette histoire de Mithridate vous préoccupait.\\n\\n--C'est vrai, monsieur, les deux études favorites de ma jeunesse ont été\\nla botanique et la minéralogie, et puis, quand j'ai su plus tard que\\nl'emploi des simples expliquait souvent toute l'histoire des peuples et\\ntoute la vie des individus d'Orient, comme les fleurs expliquent toute\\nleur pensée amoureuse, j'ai regretté de n'être pas homme pour devenir un\\nFlamel, un Fontana ou un Cabanis.\\n\\n--D'autant plus, madame, reprit Monte-Cristo, que les Orientaux ne se\\nbornent point, comme Mithridate, à se faire des poisons une cuirasse,\\nils s'en font aussi un poignard; la science devient entre leurs mains\\nnon seulement une arme défensive, mais encore fort souvent offensive;\\nl'une sert contre leurs souffrances physiques, l'autre contre leurs\\nennemis; avec l'opium, avec la belladone, avec la fausse angusture, le\\nbois de couleuvre, le laurier-cerise, ils endorment ceux qui voudraient\\nles réveiller. Il n'est pas une de ces femmes, égyptienne, turque ou\\ngrecque, qu'ici vous appelez de bonnes femmes, qui ne sache en fait de\\nchimie de quoi stupéfier un médecin, et en fait de psychologie de quoi\\népouvanter un confesseur.\\n\\n--Vraiment! dit Mme de Villefort, dont les yeux brillaient d'un feu\\nétrange à cette conversation.\\n\\n--Eh! mon Dieu! oui, madame, continua Monte-Cristo, les drames secrets\\nde l'Orient se nouent et se dénouent ainsi, depuis la plante qui fait\\naimer jusqu'à la plante qui fait mourir; depuis le breuvage qui ouvre le\\nciel jusqu'à celui qui vous plonge un homme dans l'enfer. Il y a autant\\nde nuances de tous genres qu'il y a de caprices et de bizarreries dans\\nla nature humaine, physique et morale; et je dirai plus, l'art de ces\\nchimistes sait accommoder admirablement le remède et le mal à ses\\nbesoins d'amour ou à ses désirs de vengeance.\\n\\n--Mais, monsieur, reprit la jeune femme, ces sociétés orientales au\\nmilieu desquelles vous avez passé une partie de votre existence sont\\ndonc fantastiques comme les contes qui nous viennent de leur beau pays?\\nun homme y peut donc être supprimé impunément? c'est donc en réalité la\\nBagdad ou la Bassora de M. Galland? Les sultans et les vizirs qui\\nrégissent ces sociétés, et qui constituent ce qu'on appelle en France le\\ngouvernement, sont donc sérieusement des Haroun-al-Raschid et des\\nGiaffar qui non seulement pardonnent à un empoisonneur, mais encore le\\nfont premier ministre si le crime a été ingénieux, et qui, dans ce cas,\\nen font graver l'histoire en lettres d'or pour se divertir aux heures de\\nleur ennui?\\n\\n--Non, madame, le fantastique n'existe plus même en Orient: il y a\\nlà-bas aussi, déguisés sous d'autres noms et cachés sous d'autres\\ncostumes, des commissaires de police, des juges d'instruction, des\\nprocureurs du roi et des experts. On y pend, on y décapite et l'on y\\nempale très agréablement les criminels; mais ceux-ci en fraudeurs\\nadroits, ont su dépister la justice humaine et assurer le succès de\\nleurs entreprises par des combinaisons habiles. Chez nous, un niais\\npossédé du démon de la haine ou de la cupidité, qui a un ennemi à\\ndétruire ou un grand-parent à annihiler, s'en va chez un épicier, lui\\ndonne un faux nom qui le fait découvrir bien mieux que son nom\\nvéritable, et achète, sous prétexte que les rats l'empêchent de dormir,\\ncinq à six grammes d'arsenic; s'il est très adroit, il va chez cinq ou\\nsix épiciers, et n'en est que cinq ou six fois mieux reconnu; puis,\\nquand il possède son spécifique, il administre à son ennemi, à son\\ngrand-parent, une dose d'arsenic qui ferait crever un mammouth ou un\\nmastodonte, et qui, sans rime ni raison, fait pousser à la victime des\\nhurlements qui mettent tout le quartier en émoi. Alors arrive une nuée\\nd'agents de police et de gendarmes, on envoie chercher un médecin qui\\nouvre le mort et récolte dans son estomac et dans ses entrailles\\nl'arsenic à la cuiller. Le lendemain, cent journaux racontent le fait\\navec le nom de la victime et du meurtrier. Dès le soir même, l'épicier\\nou les épiciers vient ou viennent dire: «C'est moi qui ai vendu\\nl'arsenic à monsieur.» Et plutôt que de ne pas reconnaître l'acquéreur,\\nils en reconnaîtront vingt; alors le niais criminel est pris,\\nemprisonné, interrogé, confronté, confondu, condamné et guillotiné; ou\\nsi c'est une femme de quelque valeur, on l'enferme pour la vie. Voilà\\ncomme vos Septentrionaux entendent la chimie, madame. Desrues cependant\\nétait plus fort que cela, je dois l'avouer.\\n\\n--Que voulez-vous! monsieur, dit en riant la jeune femme, on fait ce\\nqu'on peut. Tout le monde n'a pas le secret des Médicis ou des Borgia.\\n\\n--Maintenant, dit le comte en haussant les épaules, voulez-vous que je\\nvous dise ce qui cause toutes ces inepties? C'est que sur vos théâtres,\\nà ce dont j'ai pu juger du moins en lisant les pièces qu'on y joue, on\\nvoit toujours des gens avaler le contenu d'une fiole ou mordre le chaton\\nd'une bague et tomber raides morts: cinq minutes après, le rideau\\nbaisse; les spectateurs sont dispersés. On ignore les suites du meurtre;\\non ne voit jamais ni le commissaire de police avec son écharpe, ni le\\ncaporal avec ses quatre hommes, et cela autorise beaucoup de pauvres\\ncerveaux à croire que les choses se passent ainsi. Mais sortez un peu de\\nFrance, allez soit à Alep soit au Caire, soit seulement à Naples et à\\nRome, et vous verrez passer par la rue des gens droits, frais et roses\\ndont le Diable boiteux, s'il vous effleurait de son manteau, pourrait\\nvous dire: «Ce monsieur est empoisonné depuis trois semaines, et il sera\\ntout à fait mort dans un mois.»\\n\\n--Mais alors, dit Mme de Villefort, ils ont donc retrouvé le secret de\\ncette fameuse aqua-tofana que l'on me disait perdu à Pérouse.\\n\\n--Eh, mon Dieu! madame, est-ce que quelque chose se perd chez les\\nhommes! Les arts se déplacent et font le tour du monde; les choses\\nchangent de nom, voilà tout, et le vulgaire s'y trompe; mais c'est\\ntoujours le même résultat, le poison porte particulièrement sur tel ou\\ntel organe; l'un sur l'estomac, l'autre sur le cerveau, l'autre sur les\\nintestins. Eh bien, le poison détermine une toux, cette toux une\\nfluxion de poitrine ou telle autre maladie cataloguée au livre de la\\nscience, ce qui ne l'empêche pas d'être parfaitement mortelle, et qui,\\nne le fût-elle pas, le deviendrait grâce aux remèdes que lui\\nadministrent les naïfs médecins, en général fort mauvais chimistes, et\\nqui tourneront pour ou contre la maladie, comme il vous plaira, et voilà\\nun homme tué avec art et dans toutes les règles, sur lequel la justice\\nn'a rien à apprendre, comme disait un horrible chimiste de mes amis,\\nl'excellent abbé Ademonte de Taormine, en Sicile, lequel avait fort\\nétudié ces phénomènes nationaux.\\n\\n--C'est effrayant, mais c'est admirable, dit la jeune femme immobile\\nd'attention; je croyais, je l'avoue, toutes ces histoires des inventions\\ndu Moyen Âge?\\n\\n--Oui, sans doute, mais qui se sont encore perfectionnées de nos jours.\\nÀ quoi donc voulez-vous que servent le temps, les encouragements, les\\nmédailles, les croix, les prix Montyon, si ce n'est pour mener la\\nsociété vers sa plus grande perfection? Or, l'homme ne sera parfait que\\nlorsqu'il saura créer et détruire comme Dieu, il sait déjà détruire,\\nc'est la moitié du chemin de fait.\\n\\n--De sorte, reprit Mme de Villefort revenant invariablement à son but,\\nque les poisons des Borgia, des Médicis, des René, des Ruggieri, et plus\\ntard probablement du baron de Trenk, dont ont tant abusé le drame\\nmoderne et le roman....\\n\\n--Étaient des objets d'art, madame, pas autre chose, répondit le comte.\\nCroyez-vous que le vrai savant s'adresse banalement à l'individu même?\\nNon pas. La science aime les ricochets, les tours de force, la\\nfantaisie, si l'on peut dire cela. Ainsi, par exemple cet excellent abbé\\nAdelmonte, dont je vous parlais tout à l'heure, avait fait, sous ce\\nrapport, des expériences étonnantes.\\n\\n--Vraiment!\\n\\n--Oui, je vous en citerai une seule. Il avait un fort beau jardin plein\\nde légumes, de fleurs et de fruits; parmi ces légumes, il choisissait le\\nplus honnête de tous, un chou, par exemple. Pendant trois jours il\\narrosait ce chou avec une dissolution d'arsenic; le troisième jour, le\\nchou tombait malade et jaunissait, c'était le moment de le couper; pour\\ntous il paraissait mûr et conservait son apparence honnête: pour l'abbé\\nAdelmonte seul il était empoisonné. Alors, il apportait le chou chez\\nlui, prenait un lapin--l'abbé Adelmonte avait une collection de lapins,\\nde chats et de cochons d'Inde qui ne le cédait en rien à sa collection\\nde légumes, de fleurs et de fruits--l'abbé Adelmonte prenait donc un\\nlapin et lui faisait manger une feuille de chou, le lapin mourait. Quel\\nest le juge d'instruction qui oserait trouver à redire à cela, et quel\\nest le procureur du roi qui s'est jamais avisé de dresser contre M.\\nMagendie ou M. Flourens un réquisitoire à propos des lapins, des cochons\\nd'Inde et des chats qu'ils ont tués? Aucun. Voilà donc le lapin mort\\nsans que la justice s'en inquiète. Ce lapin mort, l'abbé Adelmonte le\\nfait vider par sa cuisinière et jette les intestins sur un fumier. Sur\\nce fumier, il y a une poule, elle becquette ces intestins, tombe malade\\nà son tour et meurt le lendemain. Au moment où elle se débat dans les\\nconvulsions de l'agonie, un vautour passe (il y a beaucoup de vautours\\ndans le pays d'Adelmonte), celui-là fond sur le cadavre, l'emporte sur\\nun rocher et en dîne. Trois jours après, le pauvre vautour, qui, depuis\\nce repas, s'est trouvé constamment indisposé, se sent pris d'un\\nétourdissement au plus haut de la nue; il roule dans le vide et vient\\ntomber lourdement dans votre vivier; le brochet, l'anguille et la murène\\nmangent goulûment, vous savez cela, ils mordent le vautour.... Eh bien,\\nsupposez que le lendemain l'on serve sur votre table cette anguille, ce\\nbrochet ou cette murène, empoisonnés à la quatrième génération, votre\\nconvive, lui, sera empoisonné à la cinquième et mourra au bout de huit\\nou dix jours de douleurs d'entrailles, de maux de coeur, d'abcès au\\npylore. On fera l'autopsie, et les médecins diront: «Le sujet est mort\\nd'une tumeur au foie ou d'une fièvre typhoïde.»\\n\\n--Mais, dit Mme de Villefort, toutes ces circonstances, que vous\\nenchaînez les unes aux autres peuvent être rompues par le moindre\\naccident; le vautour peut ne pas passer à temps ou tomber à cent pas du\\nvivier.\\n\\n--Ah! voilà justement où est l'art: pour être un grand chimiste en\\nOrient, il faut diriger le hasard; on y arrive.»\\n\\nMme de Villefort était rêveuse et écoutait.\\n\\n«Mais, dit-elle, l'arsenic est indélébile; de quelque façon qu'on\\nl'absorbe, il se retrouvera dans le corps de l'homme, du moment où il\\nsera entré en quantité suffisante pour donner la mort.\\n\\n--Bien! s'écria Monte-Cristo, bien! voilà justement ce que je dis à ce\\nbon Adelmonte.\\n\\n«Il réfléchit, sourit, et me répondit par un proverbe sicilien, qui est\\naussi, je crois, un proverbe français: «Mon enfant, le monde n'a pas été\\nfait en un jour, mais en sept; revenez dimanche.»\\n\\n«Le dimanche suivant, je revins; au lieu d'avoir arrosé son chou avec de\\nl'arsenic, il l'avait arrosé avec une dissolution de sel à bas de\\nstrychnine, _strychnos colubrina_, comme disent les savants. Cette fois\\nle chou n'avait pas l'air malade le moins du monde; aussi le lapin ne\\ns'en défia-t-il point, aussi cinq minutes après le lapin était-il mort;\\nla poule mangea le lapin, et le lendemain elle était trépassée. Alors\\nnous fîmes les vautours, nous emportâmes la poule et nous l'ouvrîmes.\\nCette fois tous les symptômes particuliers avaient disparu, et il ne\\nrestait que les symptômes généraux. Aucune indication particulière dans\\naucun organe; exaspération du système nerveux, voilà tout, et trace de\\ncongestion cérébrale, pas davantage; la poule n'avait pas été\\nempoisonnée, elle était morte d'apoplexie. C'est un cas rare chez les\\npoules, je le sais bien, mais fort commun chez les hommes.»\\n\\nMme de Villefort paraissait de plus en plus rêveuse.\\n\\n«C'est bien heureux, dit-elle, que de pareilles substances ne puissent\\nêtre préparées que par des chimistes, car, en vérité, la moitié du monde\\nempoisonnerait l'autre.\\n\\n--Par des chimistes ou des personnes qui s'occupent de chimie, répondit\\nnégligemment Monte-Cristo.\\n\\n--Et puis, dit Mme de Villefort s'arrachant elle-même et avec effort à\\nses pensées, si savamment préparé qu'il soit, le crime est toujours le\\ncrime: et s'il échappe à l'investigation humaine, il n'échappe pas au\\nregard de Dieu. Les Orientaux sont plus forts que nous sur les cas de\\nconscience, et ont prudemment supprimé l'enfer; voilà tout.\\n\\n--Eh! madame, ceci est un scrupule qui doit naturellement naître dans\\nune âme honnête comme la vôtre, mais qui en serait bientôt déraciné par\\nle raisonnement. Le mauvais côté de la pensée humaine sera toujours\\nrésumé par ce paradoxe de Jean-Jacques Rousseau, vous savez: «Le\\nmandarin qu'on tue à cinq mille lieues en levant le bout du doigt.» La\\nvie de l'homme se passe à faire de ces choses-là, et son intelligence\\ns'épuise à les rêver. Vous trouvez fort peu de gens qui s'en aillent\\nbrutalement planter un couteau dans le coeur de leur semblable ou qui\\nadministrent, pour le faire disparaître de la surface du globe, cette\\nquantité d'arsenic que nous disions tout à l'heure. C'est là réellement\\nune excentricité ou une bêtise. Pour en arriver là, il faut que le sang\\nse chauffe à trente-six degrés, que le pouls batte à quatre-vingt-dix\\npulsations, et que l'âme sorte de ses limites ordinaires; mais si,\\npassant, comme cela se pratique en philologie, du mot au synonyme\\nmitigé, vous faites une simple élimination; au lieu de commettre un\\nignoble assassinat, si vous écartez purement et simplement de votre\\nchemin celui qui vous gêne, et cela sans choc, sans violence, sans\\nl'appareil de ces souffrances, qui, devenant un supplice, font de la\\nvictime un martyr, et de celui qui agit un carnifex dans toute la force\\ndu mot; s'il n'y a ni sang, ni hurlements, ni contorsions, ni surtout\\ncette horrible et compromettante instantanéité de l'accomplissement,\\nalors vous échappez au coup de la loi humaine qui vous dit: «Ne trouble\\npas la société!» Voilà comment procèdent et réussissent les gens\\nd'Orient, personnages graves et flegmatiques, qui s'inquiètent peu des\\nquestions de temps dans les conjonctures d'une certaine importance.\\n\\n--Il reste la conscience, dit Mme de Villefort d'une voix émue et avec\\nun soupir étouffé.\\n\\n--Oui, dit Monte-Cristo, oui, heureusement, il reste la conscience, sans\\nquoi l'on serait fort malheureux. Après toute action un peu vigoureuse,\\nc'est la conscience qui nous sauve car elle nous fournit mille bonnes\\nexcuses dont seuls nous sommes juges; et ces raisons, si excellentes\\nqu'elles soient pour nous conserver le sommeil, seraient peut-être\\nmédiocres devant un tribunal pour nous conserver la vie. Ainsi Richard\\nIII, par exemple, a dû être merveilleusement servi par la conscience\\naprès la suppression des deux enfants d'Édouard IV, en effet, il pouvait\\nse dire: «Ces deux enfants d'un roi cruel et persécuteur, et qui\\navaient hérité les vices de leur père, que moi seul ai su reconnaître\\ndans leurs inclinations juvéniles; ces deux enfants me gênaient pour\\nfaire la félicité du peuple anglais, dont ils eussent infailliblement\\nfait le malheur.» Ainsi fut servie par sa conscience Lady Macbeth, qui\\nvoulait, quoi qu'en ait dit Shakespeare, donner un trône, non à son\\nmari, mais à son fils. Ah! l'amour maternel est une si grande vertu, un\\nsi puissant mobile, qu'il fait excuser bien des choses; aussi, après la\\nmort de Duncan, Lady Macbeth eut-elle été fort malheureuse sans sa\\nconscience.»\\n\\nMme de Villefort absorbait avec avidité ces effrayantes maximes et ces\\nhorribles paradoxes débités par le comte avec cette naïve ironie qui lui\\nétait particulière.\\n\\nPuis après un instant de silence:\\n\\n«Savez-vous, dit-elle, monsieur le comte, que vous êtes un terrible\\nargumentateur, et que vous voyez le monde sous un jour quelque peu\\nlivide! Est-ce donc en regardant l'humanité à travers les alambics et\\nles cornues que vous l'avez jugée telle? Car vous aviez raison, vous\\nêtes un grand chimiste, et cet élixir que vous avez fait prendre à mon\\nfils, et qui l'a si rapidement rappelé à la vie....\\n\\n--Oh! ne vous y fiez pas, madame, dit Monte-Cristo, une goutte de cet\\nélixir a suffi pour rappeler à la vie cet enfant qui se mourait, mais\\ntrois gouttes eussent poussé le sang à ses poumons de manière à lui\\ndonner des battements de coeur; six lui eussent coupé la respiration, et\\ncausé une syncope beaucoup plus grave que celle dans laquelle il se\\ntrouvait; dix enfin l'eussent foudroyé. Vous savez, madame, comme je\\nl'ai écarté vivement de ces flacons auxquels il avait l'imprudence de\\ntoucher?\\n\\n--C'est donc un poison terrible?\\n\\n--Oh! mon Dieu, non! D'abord, admettons ceci, que le mot poison n'existe\\npas, puisqu'on se sert en médecine des poisons les plus violents, qui\\ndeviennent, par la façon dont ils sont administrés, des remèdes\\nsalutaires.\\n\\n--Qu'était-ce donc alors?\\n\\n--C'était une savante préparation de mon ami, cet excellent abbé\\nAdelmonte, et dont il m'a appris à me servir.\\n\\n--Oh! dit Mme de Villefort, ce doit être un excellent antispasmodique.\\n\\n--Souverain, madame, vous l'avez vu, répondit le comte, et j'en fais un\\nusage fréquent, avec toute la prudence possible, bien entendu,\\najouta-t-il en riant.\\n\\n--Je le crois, répliqua sur le même ton Mme de Villefort. Quant à moi,\\nsi nerveuse et si prompte à m'évanouir, j'aurais besoin d'un docteur\\nAdelmonte pour m'inventer des moyens de respirer librement et me\\ntranquilliser sur la crainte que j'éprouve de mourir un beau jour\\nsuffoquée. En attendant, comme la chose est difficile à trouver en\\nFrance, et que votre abbé n'est probablement pas disposé à faire pour\\nmoi le voyage de Paris, je m'en tiens aux antispasmodiques de M.\\nPlanche, et la menthe et les gouttes d'Hoffmann jouent chez moi un grand\\nrôle. Tenez, voici des pastilles que je me fais faire exprès; elles sont\\nà double dose.»\\n\\nMonte-Cristo ouvrit la boîte d'écaille que lui présentait la jeune\\nfemme, et respira l'odeur des pastilles en amateur digne d'apprécier\\ncette préparation.\\n\\n«Elles sont exquises, dit-il, mais soumises à la nécessité de la\\ndéglutition, fonction qui souvent est impossible à accomplir de la part\\nde la personne évanouie. J'aime mieux mon spécifique.\\n\\n--Mais, bien certainement, moi aussi, je le préférerais d'après les\\neffets que j'en ai vus surtout; mais c'est un secret sans doute, et je\\nne suis pas assez indiscrète pour vous le demander.\\n\\n--Mais moi, madame, dit Monte-Cristo en se levant, je suis assez galant\\npour vous l'offrir.\\n\\n--Oh! monsieur.\\n\\n--Seulement rappelez-vous une chose: c'est qu'à petite dose c'est un\\nremède, à forte dose c'est un poison. Une goutte rend la vie, comme vous\\nl'avez vu; cinq ou six tueraient infailliblement, et d'une façon\\nd'autant plus terrible, qu'étendues dans un verre de vin, elles n'en\\nchangeraient aucunement le goût. Mais je m'arrête, madame, j'aurais\\npresque l'air de vous conseiller.»\\n\\nSix heures et demie venaient de sonner, on annonça une amie de Mme de\\nVillefort, qui venait dîner avec elle.\\n\\n«Si j'avais l'honneur de vous voir pour la troisième ou quatrième fois,\\nmonsieur le comte, au lieu de vous voir pour la seconde, dit Mme de\\nVillefort; si j'avais l'honneur d'être votre amie, au lieu d'avoir tout\\nbonnement le bonheur d'être votre obligée, j'insisterais pour vous\\nretenir à dîner, et je ne me laisserais pas battre par un premier refus.\\n\\n--Mille grâces, madame, répondit Monte-Cristo, j'ai moi-même un\\nengagement auquel je ne puis manquer. J'ai promis de conduire au\\nspectacle une princesse grecque de mes amies, qui n'a pas encore vu le\\nGrand Opéra, et qui compte sur moi pour l'y mener.\\n\\n--Allez, monsieur, mais n'oubliez pas ma recette.\\n\\n--Comment donc, madame! il faudrait pour cela oublier l'heure de\\nconversation que je viens de passer près de vous: ce qui est tout à fait\\nimpossible.\\n\\nMonte-Cristo salua et sortit.\\n\\nMme de Villefort demeura rêveuse.\\n\\n«Voilà un homme étrange, dit-elle, et qui m'a tout l'air de s'appeler,\\nde son nom de baptême, Adelmonte.»\\n\\nQuant à Monte-Cristo, le résultat avait dépassé son attente.\\n\\n«Allons, dit-il en s'en allant, voilà une bonne terre, je suis convaincu\\nque le grain qu'on y laisse tomber n'y avorte pas.»\\n\\nEt le lendemain, fidèle à sa promesse, il envoya la recette demandée.\",\n",
       " 'LIII': \"La raison de l'Opéra était d'autant meilleure à donner qu'il y avait ce\\nsoir-là solennité à l'Académie royale de musique. Levasseur, après une\\nlongue indisposition, rentrait par le rôle de Bertram, et, comme\\ntoujours, l'oeuvre du maestro à la mode avait attiré la plus brillante\\nsociété de Paris.\\n\\nMorcerf, comme la plupart des jeunes gens riches, avait sa stalle\\nd'orchestre, plus dix loges de personnes de sa connaissance auxquelles\\nil pouvait aller demander une place sans compter celle à laquelle il\\navait droit dans la loge des lions.\\n\\nChâteau-Renaud avait la stalle voisine de la sienne.\\n\\nBeauchamp, en sa qualité de journaliste, était roi de la salle et avait\\nsa place partout.\\n\\nCe soir-là, Lucien Debray avait la disposition de la loge du ministre,\\net il l'avait offerte au comte de Morcerf, lequel, sur le refus de\\nMercédès, l'avait envoyée à Danglars, en lui faisant dire qu'il irait\\nprobablement faire dans la soirée une visite à la baronne et à sa fille,\\nsi ces dames voulaient bien accepter la loge qu'il leur proposait. Ces\\ndames n'avaient eu garde de refuser. Nul n'est friand de loges qui ne\\ncoûtent rien comme un millionnaire.\\n\\nQuant à Danglars, il avait déclaré que ses principes politiques et sa\\nqualité de député de l'opposition ne lui permettaient pas d'aller dans\\nla loge du ministre. En conséquence, la baronne avait écrit à Lucien de\\nla venir prendre, attendu qu'elle ne pouvait pas aller à l'Opéra seule\\navec Eugénie.\\n\\nEn effet, si les deux femmes y eussent été seules, on eût, certes,\\ntrouvé cela fort mauvais; tandis que Mlle Danglars allant à l'Opéra avec\\nsa mère et l'amant de sa mère il n'y avait rien à dire: il faut bien\\nprendre le monde comme il est fait.\\n\\nLa toile se leva, comme d'habitude, sur une salle à peu près vide. C'est\\nencore une habitude de notre fashion parisienne, d'arriver au spectacle\\nquand le spectacle est commencé: il en résulte que le premier acte se\\npasse, de la part des spectateurs arrivés, non pas à regarder ou à\\nécouter la pièce, mais à regarder entrer les spectateurs qui arrivent,\\net à ne rien entendre que le bruit des portes et celui des\\nconversations.\\n\\n«Tiens! dit tout à coup Albert en voyant s'ouvrir une loge de côté de\\npremier rang, tiens! la comtesse G...»\\n\\n--Qu'est-ce que c'est que la comtesse G...? demanda Château-Renaud.\\n\\n--Oh! par exemple, baron, voici une question que je ne vous pardonne\\npas; vous demandez ce que c'est que la comtesse G...?\\n\\n--Ah! c'est vrai, dit Château-Renaud, n'est-ce pas cette charmante\\nVénitienne?\\n\\n--Justement.»\\n\\nEn ce moment la comtesse G... aperçut Albert et échangea avec lui un\\nsalut accompagné d'un sourire.\\n\\n«Vous la connaissez? dit Château-Renaud.\\n\\n--Oui, fit Albert; je lui ai été présenté à Rome par Franz.\\n\\n--Voudrez-vous me rendre à Paris le même service que Franz vous a rendu\\nà Rome?\\n\\n--Bien volontiers.\\n\\n--Chut!» cria le public.\\n\\nLes deux jeunes gens continuèrent leur conversation, sans paraître\\ns'inquiéter le moins du monde du désir que paraissait éprouver le\\nparterre d'entendre la musique.\\n\\n«Elle était aux courses du Champ-de-Mars, dit Château-Renaud.\\n\\n--Aujourd'hui?\\n\\n--Oui.\\n\\n--Tiens! au fait, il y avait courses. Étiez-vous engagé?\\n\\n--Oh! pour une misère, pour cinquante louis.\\n\\n--Et qui a gagné?\\n\\n--Nautilus; je pariais pour lui.\\n\\n--Mais il y avait trois courses?\\n\\n--Oui. Il y avait le prix du Jockey-Club, une coupe d'or. Il s'est même\\npassé une chose assez bizarre.\\n\\n--Laquelle?\\n\\n--Chut donc! cria le public.\\n\\n--Laquelle? répéta Albert.\\n\\n--C'est un cheval et un jockey complètement inconnus qui ont gagné cette\\ncourse.\\n\\n--Comment?\\n\\n--Oh! mon Dieu, oui, personne n'avait fait attention à un cheval inscrit\\nsous le nom de _Vampa_ et à un jockey inscrit sous le nom de _Job_,\\nquand on a vu s'avancer tout à coup un admirable alezan et un jockey\\ngros comme le poing; on a été obligé de lui fourrer vingt livres de\\nplomb dans ses poches, ce qui ne l'a pas empêché d'arriver au but trois\\nlongueurs de cheval avant _Ariel et Barbaro_, qui couraient avec lui.\\n\\n--Et l'on n'a pas su à qui appartenaient le cheval et le jockey?\\n\\n--Non.\\n\\n--Vous dites que ce cheval était inscrit sous le nom de....\\n\\n--_Vampa_.\\n\\n--Alors, dit Albert, je suis plus avancé que vous, je sais à qui il\\nappartenait, moi.\\n\\n--Silence donc!» cria pour la troisième fois le parterre.\\n\\nCette fois la levée de boucliers était si grande, que les deux jeunes\\ngens s'aperçurent enfin que c'était à eux que le public s'adressait. Ils\\nse retournèrent un instant, cherchant dans cette foule un homme qui prit\\nla responsabilité de ce qu'ils regardaient comme une impertinence; mais\\npersonne ne réitéra l'invitation, et ils se retournèrent vers la scène.\\nEn ce moment la loge du ministre s'ouvrait, et Mme Danglars, sa fille et\\nLucien Debray prenaient leurs places.\\n\\n«Ah! ah! dit Château-Renaud, voilà des personnes de votre connaissance,\\nvicomte. Que diable regardez-vous donc à droite? On vous cherche.»\\n\\nAlbert se retourna et ses yeux rencontrèrent effectivement ceux de la\\nbaronne Danglars, qui lui fit avec son éventail un petit salut. Quant à\\nMlle Eugénie, ce fut à peine si ses grands yeux noirs daignèrent\\ns'abaisser jusqu'à l'orchestre.\\n\\n«En vérité, mon cher, dit Château-Renaud, je ne comprends point, à part\\nla mésalliance, et je ne crois point que ce soit cela qui vous préoccupe\\nbeaucoup; je ne comprends pas, dis-je, à part la mésalliance, ce que\\nvous pouvez avoir contre Mlle Danglars; c'est en vérité une fort belle\\npersonne.\\n\\n--Fort belle, certainement, dit Albert; mais je vous avoue qu'en fait de\\nbeauté j'aimerais mieux quelque chose de plus doux, de plus suave, de\\nplus féminin, enfin.\\n\\n--Voilà bien les jeunes gens, dit Château-Renaud qui, en sa qualité\\nd'homme de trente ans, prenait avec Morcerf des airs paternels; ils ne\\nsont jamais satisfaits. Comment, mon cher! on vous trouve une fiancée\\nbâtie sur le modèle de la Diane chasseresse et vous n'êtes pas content!\\n\\n--Eh bien, justement, j'aurais mieux aimé quelque chose dans le genre de\\nla Vénus de Milo ou de Capoue. Cette Diane chasseresse, toujours au\\nmilieu de ses nymphes, m'épouvante un peu, j'ai peur qu'elle ne me\\ntraite en Actéon.»\\n\\nEn effet, un coup d'oeil jeté sur la jeune fille pouvait presque\\nexpliquer le sentiment que venait d'avouer Morcerf. Mlle Danglars était\\nbelle, mais, comme l'avait dit Albert, d'une beauté un peu arrêtée: ses\\ncheveux étaient d'un beau noir, mais dans leurs ondes naturelles on\\nremarquait une certaine rébellion à la main qui voulait leur imposer sa\\nvolonté; ses yeux, noirs comme ses cheveux, encadrés sous de magnifiques\\nsourcils qui n'avaient qu'un défaut, celui de se froncer quelquefois,\\nétaient surtout remarquables par une expression de fermeté qu'on était\\nétonné de trouver dans le regard d'une femme; son nez avait les\\nproportions exactes qu'un statuaire eût données à celui de Junon: sa\\nbouche seule était trop grande, mais garnie de belles dents que\\nfaisaient ressortir encore des lèvres dont le carmin trop vif tranchait\\navec la pâleur de son teint; enfin un signe noir placé au coin de la\\nbouche, et plus large que ne le sont d'ordinaire ces sortes de caprices\\nde la nature, achevait de donner à cette physionomie ce caractère décidé\\nqui effrayait quelque peu Morcerf.\\n\\nD'ailleurs, tout le reste de la personne d'Eugénie s'alliait avec cette\\ntête que nous venons d'essayer de décrire. C'était, comme l'avait dit\\nChâteau-Renaud, la Diane chasseresse, mais avec quelque chose encore de\\nplus ferme et de plus musculeux dans sa beauté.\\n\\nQuant à l'éducation, qu'elle avait reçue, s'il y avait un reproche à lui\\nfaire, c'est que, comme certains points de sa physionomie, elle semblait\\nun peu appartenir à un autre sexe. En effet, elle parlait deux ou trois\\nlangues, dessinait facilement, faisait des vers et composait de la\\nmusique; elle était surtout passionnée pour ce dernier art, qu'elle\\nétudiait avec une de ses amies de pension, jeune personne sans fortune,\\nmais ayant toutes les dispositions possibles pour devenir, à ce que l'on\\nassurait, une excellente cantatrice. Un grand compositeur portait,\\ndisait-on, à cette dernière, un intérêt presque paternel, et la faisait\\ntravailler avec l'espoir qu'elle trouverait un jour une fortune dans sa\\nvoix.\\n\\nCette possibilité que Mlle Louise d'Armilly, c'était le nom de la jeune\\nvirtuose, entrât un jour au théâtre faisait que Mlle Danglars, quoique\\nla recevant chez elle, ne se montrait point en public en sa compagnie.\\nDu reste, sans avoir dans la maison du banquier la position indépendante\\nd'une amie, Louise avait une position supérieure à celle des\\ninstitutrices ordinaires.\\n\\nQuelques secondes après l'entrée de Mme Danglars dans sa loge, la toile\\navait baissé et, grâce à cette faculté, laissée par la longueur des\\nentractes, de se promener au foyer ou de faire des visites pendant une\\ndemi-heure, l'orchestre s'était à peu près dégarni.\\n\\nMorcerf et Château-Renaud étaient sortis des premiers. Un instant Mme\\nDanglars avait pensé que cet empressement d'Albert avait pour but de lui\\nvenir présenter ses compliments, et elle s'était penchée à l'oreille de\\nsa fille pour lui annoncer cette visite, mais celle-ci s'était\\ncontentée de secouer la tête en souriant; et en même temps, comme pour\\nprouver combien la dénégation d'Eugénie était fondée, Morcerf apparut\\ndans une loge de côté du premier rang. Cette loge était celle de la\\ncomtesse G...\\n\\n«Ah! vous voilà, monsieur le voyageur, dit celle-ci en lui tendant la\\nmain avec toute la cordialité d'une vieille connaissance; c'est bien\\naimable à vous de m'avoir reconnue, et surtout de m'avoir donné la\\npréférence pour votre première visite.\\n\\n--Croyez, madame, répondit Albert, que si j'eusse su votre arrivée à\\nParis et connu votre adresse, je n'eusse point attendu si tard. Mais\\nveuillez me permettre de vous présenter M. le baron de Château-Renaud,\\nmon ami, un des rares gentilshommes qui restent encore en France, et par\\nlequel je viens d'apprendre que vous étiez aux courses du\\nChamp-de-Mars.»\\n\\nChâteau-Renaud salua.\\n\\n«Ah! vous étiez aux courses, monsieur? dit vivement la comtesse.\\n\\n--Oui, madame.\\n\\n--Eh bien, reprit vivement Mme G..., pouvez-vous me dire à qui\\nappartenait le cheval qui a gagné le prix du Jockey-Club?\\n\\n--Non, madame, dit Château-Renaud, et je faisais tout à l'heure la même\\nquestion à Albert.\\n\\n--Y tenez-vous beaucoup, madame la comtesse? demanda Albert.\\n\\n--À quoi?\\n\\n--À connaître le maître du cheval?\\n\\n--Infiniment. Imaginez-vous.... Mais sauriez-vous qui, par hasard,\\nvicomte?\\n\\n--Madame, vous alliez raconter une histoire: imaginez-vous, avez-vous\\ndit.\\n\\n--Eh bien, imaginez-vous que ce charmant cheval alezan et ce joli petit\\njockey à casaque rose m'avaient, à la première vue, inspiré une si vive\\nsympathie, que je faisais des voeux pour l'un et pour l'autre,\\nexactement comme si j'avais engagé sur eux la moitié de ma fortune;\\naussi, lorsque je les vis arriver au but, devançant les autres coureurs\\nde trois longueurs de cheval, je fus si joyeuse que je me mis à battre\\ndes mains comme une folle. Figurez-vous mon étonnement lorsque, en\\nrentrant chez moi, je rencontrai sur mon escalier le petit jockey rose!\\nJe crus que le vainqueur de la course demeurait par hasard dans la même\\nmaison que moi, lorsque, en ouvrant la porte de mon salon, la première\\nchose que je vis fut la coupe d'or qui formait le prix gagné par le\\ncheval et le jockey inconnus. Dans la coupe il y avait un petit papier\\nsur lequel étaient écrits ces mots: «À la comtesse G..., Lord Ruthwen.»\\n\\n--C'est justement cela, dit Morcerf.\\n\\n--Comment! c'est justement cela; que voulez-vous dire?\\n\\n--Je veux dire que c'est Lord Ruthwen en personne.\\n\\n--Quel Lord Ruthwen?\\n\\n--Le nôtre, le vampire, celui du théâtre Argentina.\\n\\n--Vraiment! s'écria la comtesse; il est donc ici?\\n\\n--Parfaitement.\\n\\n--Et vous le voyez? vous le recevez? vous allez chez lui?\\n\\n--C'est mon ami intime, et M. de Château-Renaud lui-même a l'honneur de\\nle connaître.\\n\\n--Qui peut vous faire croire que c'est lui qui a gagné?\\n\\n--Son cheval inscrit sous le nom de _Vampa_...\\n\\n--Eh bien, après?\\n\\n--Eh bien, vous ne vous rappelez pas le nom du fameux bandit qui m'avait\\nfait prisonnier?\\n\\n--Ah! c'est vrai.\\n\\n--Et des mains duquel le comte m'a miraculeusement tiré?\\n\\n--Si fait.\\n\\n--Il s'appelait _Vampa_. Vous voyez bien que c'est lui.\\n\\n--Mais pourquoi m'a-t-il envoyé cette coupe, à moi?\\n\\n--D'abord, madame la comtesse, parce que je lui avais fort parlé de\\nvous, comme vous pouvez le croire; ensuite parce qu'il aura été enchanté\\nde retrouver une compatriote, et heureux de l'intérêt que cette\\ncompatriote prenait à lui.\\n\\n--J'espère bien que vous ne lui avez jamais raconté les folies que nous\\navons dites à son sujet!\\n\\n--Ma foi, je n'en jurerais pas, et cette façon de vous offrir cette\\ncoupe sous le nom de Lord Ruthwen....\\n\\n--Mais c'est affreux, il va m'en vouloir mortellement.\\n\\n--Son procédé est-il celui d'un ennemi?\\n\\n--Non, je l'avoue.\\n\\n--Eh bien!\\n\\n--Ainsi, il est à Paris?\\n\\n--Oui.\\n\\n--Et quelle sensation a-t-il faite?\\n\\n--Mais, dit Albert, on en a parlé huit jours, puis sont arrivés le\\ncouronnement de la reine d'Angleterre et le vol des diamants de Mlle\\nMars, et l'on n'a plus parlé que de cela.\\n\\n--Mon cher, dit Château-Renaud, on voit bien que le comte est votre ami,\\nvous le traitez en conséquence. Ne croyez pas ce que vous dit Albert,\\nmadame la comtesse, il n'est au contraire question que du comte de\\nMonte-Cristo à Paris. Il a d'abord débuté par envoyer à Mme Danglars des\\nchevaux de trente mille francs; puis il a sauvé la vie à Mme de\\nVillefort; puis il a gagné la course du Jockey-Club à ce qu'il paraît.\\nJe maintiens au contraire, moi, quoi qu'en dise Morcerf, qu'on s'occupe\\nencore du comte en ce moment, et qu'on ne s'occupera même plus que de\\nlui dans un mois, s'il veut continuer de faire de l'excentricité, ce\\nqui, au reste, paraît être sa manière de vivre ordinaire.\\n\\n--C'est possible, dit Morcerf; en attendant, qui donc a repris la loge\\nde l'ambassadeur de Russie?\\n\\n--Laquelle? demanda la comtesse.\\n\\n--L'entre-colonne du premier rang; elle me semble parfaitement remise à\\nneuf.\\n\\n--En effet, dit Château-Renaud. Est-ce qu'il y avait quelqu'un pendant le\\npremier acte?\\n\\n--Où?\\n\\n--Dans cette loge?\\n\\n--Non, reprit la comtesse, je n'ai vu personne; ainsi, continua-t-elle,\\nrevenant à la première conversation, vous croyez que c'est votre comte\\nde Monte-Cristo qui a gagné le prix?\\n\\n--J'en suis sûr.\\n\\n--Et qui m'a envoyé cette coupe?\\n\\n--Sans aucun doute.\\n\\n--Mais je ne le connais pas, moi, dit la comtesse, et j'ai fort envie de\\nla lui renvoyer.\\n\\n--Oh! n'en faites rien; il vous en enverrait une autre, taillée dans\\nquelque saphir ou creusée dans quelque rubis. Ce sont ses manières\\nd'agir; que voulez-vous, il faut le prendre comme il est.»\\n\\nEn ce moment on entendit la sonnette qui annonçait que le deuxième acte\\nallait commencer. Albert se leva pour regagner sa place.\\n\\n«Vous verrai-je? demanda la comtesse.\\n\\n--Dans les entractes, si vous le permettez, je viendrai m'informer si je\\npuis vous être bon à quelque chose à Paris.\\n\\n--Messieurs, dit la comtesse, tous les samedis soir, rue de Rivoli, 22,\\nje suis chez moi pour mes amis. Vous voilà prévenus.»\\n\\nLes jeunes gens saluèrent et sortirent.\\n\\nEn entrant dans la salle, ils virent le parterre debout et les yeux\\nfixés sur un seul point de la salle; leurs regards suivirent la\\ndirection générale, et s'arrêtèrent sur l'ancienne loge de l'ambassadeur\\nde Russie. Un homme habillé de noir, de trente-cinq à quarante ans,\\nvenait d'y entrer avec une femme vêtue d'un costume oriental. La femme\\nétait de la plus grande beauté, et le costume d'une telle richesse que\\ncomme nous l'avons dit, tous les yeux s'étaient à l'instant tournés vers\\nelle.\\n\\n«Eh! dit Albert, c'est Monte-Cristo et sa Grecque.»\\n\\nEn effet, c'était le comte et Haydée.\\n\\nAu bout d'un instant, la jeune femme était l'objet de l'attention non\\nseulement du parterre, mais de toute la salle; les femmes se penchaient\\nhors des loges pour voir ruisseler sous les feux des lustres cette\\ncascade de diamants.\\n\\nLe second acte se passa au milieu de cette rumeur sourde qui indique\\ndans les masses assemblées un grand événement. Personne ne songea à\\ncrier silence. Cette femme si jeune, si belle, si éblouissante, était le\\nplus curieux spectacle qu'on pût voir.\\n\\nCette fois, un signe de Mme Danglars indiqua clairement à Albert que la\\nbaronne désirait avoir sa visite dans l'entracte suivant.\\n\\nMorcerf était de trop bon goût pour se faire attendre quand on lui\\nindiquait clairement qu'il était attendu. L'acte fini, il se hâta donc\\nde monter dans l'avant-scène.\\n\\nIl salua les deux dames et tendit la main à Debray.\\n\\nLa baronne l'accueillit avec un charmant sourire et Eugénie avec sa\\nfroideur habituelle.\\n\\n«Ma foi, mon cher, dit Debray, vous voyez un homme à bout, et qui vous\\nappelle en aide pour le relayer. Voici madame qui m'écrase de questions\\nsur le comte, et qui veut que je sache d'où il est, d'où il vient, où il\\nva; ma foi, je ne suis pas Cagliostro, moi, et pour me tirer d'affaire,\\nj'ai dit: «Demandez tout cela à Morcerf, il connaît son Monte-Cristo sur\\nle bout du doigt»; alors on vous a fait signe.\\n\\n--N'est-il pas incroyable, dit la baronne, que lorsqu'on a un\\ndemi-million de fonds secrets à sa disposition on ne soit pas mieux\\ninstruit que cela?\\n\\n--Madame, dit Lucien, je vous prie de croire que si j'avais un\\ndemi-million à ma disposition, je l'emploierais à autre chose qu'à\\nprendre des informations sur M. de Monte-Cristo, qui n'a d'autre mérite\\nà mes yeux que d'être deux fois riche comme un nabab; mais j'ai passé la\\nparole à mon ami Morcerf; arrangez-vous avec lui, cela ne me regarde\\nplus.\\n\\n--Un nabab ne m'eût certainement pas envoyé une paire de chevaux de\\ntrente mille francs, avec quatre diamants aux oreilles, de cinq mille\\nfrancs chacun.\\n\\n--Oh! les diamants, dit en riant Morcerf, c'est sa manie. Je crois que,\\npareil à Potemkin, il en a toujours dans ses poches, et qu'il en sème\\nsur son chemin comme le petit Poucet faisait de ses cailloux.\\n\\n--Il aura trouvé quelque mine, dit Mme Danglars; vous savez qu'il a un\\ncrédit illimité sur la maison du baron?\\n\\n--Non, je ne le savais pas, répondit Albert, mais cela doit être.\\n\\n--Et qu'il a annoncé à M. Danglars qu'il comptait rester un an à Paris\\net y dépenser six millions?\\n\\n--C'est le schah de Perse qui voyage incognito.\\n\\n--Et cette femme, monsieur Lucien, dit Eugénie, avez-vous remarqué comme\\nelle est belle?\\n\\n--En vérité, mademoiselle, je ne connais que vous pour faire si bonne\\njustice aux personnes de votre sexe.»\\n\\nLucien approcha son lorgnon de son oeil.\\n\\n«Charmante! dit-il.\\n\\n--Et cette femme, M. de Morcerf sait-il qui elle est?\\n\\n--Mademoiselle, dit Albert, répondant à cette interpellation presque\\ndirecte, je le sais à peu près, comme tout ce qui regarde le personnage\\nmystérieux dont nous nous occupons. Cette femme est une Grecque.\\n\\n--Cela se voit facilement à son costume, et vous ne m'apprenez là que ce\\nque toute la salle sait déjà comme nous.\\n\\n--Je suis fâché, dit Morcerf, d'être un cicérone si ignorant, mais je\\ndois avouer que là se bornent mes connaissances; je sais, en outre\\nqu'elle est musicienne, car un jour que j'ai déjeuné chez le comte, j'ai\\nentendu les sons d'une guzla qui ne pouvaient venir certainement que\\nd'elle.\\n\\n--Il reçoit donc, votre comte? demanda Mme Danglars.\\n\\n--Et d'une façon splendide, je vous le jure.\\n\\n--Il faut que je pousse Danglars à lui offrir quelque dîner, quelque\\nbal, afin qu'il nous les rende.\\n\\n--Comment, vous irez chez lui? dit Debray en riant.\\n\\n--Pourquoi pas? avec mon mari!\\n\\n--Mais il est garçon, ce mystérieux comte.\\n\\n--Vous voyez bien que non, dit en riant à son tour la baronne, en\\nmontrant la belle Grecque.\\n\\n--Cette femme est une esclave, à ce qu'il nous a dit lui-même, vous\\nrappelez-vous, Morcerf? à votre déjeuner?\\n\\n--Convenez, mon cher Lucien, dit la baronne qu'elle a bien plutôt l'air\\nd'une princesse.\\n\\n--Des _Mille et une Nuits_.\\n\\n--Des _Mille et une Nuits_, je ne dis pas; mais qu'est-ce qui fait les\\nprincesses, mon cher? ce sont les diamants, et celle-ci en est couverte.\\n\\n--Elle en a même trop, dit Eugénie; elle serait plus belle sans cela,\\ncar on verrait son cou et ses poignets, qui sont charmants de forme.\\n\\n--Oh! l'artiste. Tenez, dit Mme Danglars, la voyez-vous qui se\\npassionne?\\n\\n--J'aime tout ce qui est beau, dit Eugénie.\\n\\n--Mais que dites-vous du comte alors? dit Debray, il me semble qu'il\\nn'est pas mal non plus.\\n\\n--Le comte? dit Eugénie, comme si elle n'eût point encore pensé à le\\nregarder, le comte, il est bien pâle.\\n\\n--Justement, dit Morcerf, c'est dans cette pâleur qu'est le secret que\\nnous cherchons. La comtesse G... prétend, vous le savez, que c'est un\\nvampire.\\n\\n--Elle est donc de retour, la comtesse G...? demanda la baronne.\\n\\n--Dans cette loge de côté, dit Eugénie, presque en face de nous, ma\\nmère; cette femme, avec ces admirables cheveux blonds, c'est elle.\\n\\n--Oh! oui, dit Mme Danglars; vous ne savez pas ce que vous devriez\\nfaire, Morcerf?\\n\\n--Ordonnez, madame.\\n\\n--Vous devriez aller faire une visite à votre comte de Monte-Cristo et\\nnous l'amener.\\n\\n--Pourquoi faire? dit Eugénie.\\n\\n--Mais pour que nous lui parlions; n'es-tu pas curieuse de le voir?\\n\\n--Pas le moins du monde.\\n\\n--Étrange enfant! murmura la baronne.\\n\\n--Oh! dit Morcerf, il viendra probablement de lui-même. Tenez, il vous\\na vue, madame, et il vous salue.»\\n\\nLa baronne rendit au comte son salut, accompagné d'un charmant sourire.\\n\\n«Allons, dit Morcerf, je me sacrifie; je vous quitte et vais voir s'il\\nn'y a pas moyen de lui parler.\\n\\n--Allez dans sa loge; c'est bien simple.\\n\\n--Mais je ne suis pas présenté.\\n\\n--À qui?\\n\\n--À la belle Grecque.\\n\\n--C'est une esclave, dites-vous?\\n\\n--Oui, mais vous prétendez, vous, que c'est une princesse.... Non.\\nJ'espère que lorsqu'il me verra sortir il sortira.\\n\\n--C'est possible. Allez!\\n\\n--J'y vais.»\\n\\nMorcerf salua et sortit. Effectivement, au moment où il passait devant\\nla loge du comte, la porte s'ouvrit; le comte dit quelques mots en arabe\\nà Ali, qui se tenait dans le corridor, et prit le bras de Morcerf.\\n\\nAli referma la porte, et se tint debout devant elle; il y avait dans le\\ncorridor un rassemblement autour du Nubien.\\n\\n«En vérité, dit Monte-Cristo, votre Paris est une étrange ville, et vos\\nParisiens un singulier peuple. On dirait que c'est la première fois\\nqu'ils voient un Nubien. Regardez-les donc se presser autour de ce\\npauvre Ali, qui ne sait pas ce que cela veut dire. Je vous réponds d'une\\nchose, par exemple, c'est qu'un Parisien peut aller à Tunis, à\\nConstantinople, à Bagdad ou au Caire, on ne fera pas cercle autour de\\nlui.\\n\\n--C'est que vos Orientaux sont des gens sensés, et qu'ils ne regardent\\nque ce qui vaut la peine d'être vu; mais croyez-moi, Ali ne jouit de\\ncette popularité que parce qu'il vous appartient, et qu'en ce moment\\nvous êtes l'homme à la mode.\\n\\n--Vraiment! et qui me vaut cette faveur?\\n\\n--Parbleu! vous-même. Vous donnez des attelages de mille louis; vous\\nsauvez la vie à des femmes de procureur du roi; vous faites courir,\\nsous le nom de major Brack, des chevaux pur sang et des jockeys gros\\ncomme des ouistitis; enfin, vous gagnez des coupes d'or, et vous les\\nenvoyez aux jolies femmes.\\n\\n--Et qui diable vous a conté toutes ces folies?\\n\\n--Dame! la première, Mme Danglars, qui meurt d'envie de vous voir dans\\nsa loge, ou plutôt qu'on vous y voie; la seconde, le journal de\\nBeauchamp, et la troisième, ma propre imaginative. Pourquoi appelez-vous\\nvotre cheval _Vampa_, si vous voulez garder l'incognito?\\n\\n--Ah! c'est vrai! dit le comte, c'est une imprudence. Mais dites-moi\\ndonc, le comte de Morcerf ne vient-il point quelquefois à l'Opéra? Je\\nl'ai cherché des yeux, et je ne l'ai aperçu nulle part.\\n\\n--Il viendra ce soir.\\n\\n--Où cela?\\n\\n--Dans la loge de la baronne, je crois.\\n\\n--Cette charmante personne qui est avec elle, c'est sa fille?\\n\\n--Oui.\\n\\n--Je vous en fais mon compliment.»\\n\\nMorcerf sourit.\\n\\n«Nous reparlerons de cela plus tard et en détail, dit-il. Que dites-vous\\nde la musique?\\n\\n--De quelle musique?\\n\\n--Mais de celle que vous venez d'entendre.\\n\\n--Je dis que c'est de fort belle musique pour de la musique composée par\\nun compositeur humain, et chantée par des oiseaux à deux pieds et sans\\nplumes, comme disait feu Diogène.\\n\\n--Ah çà! mais, mon cher comte, il semblerait que vous pourriez entendre\\nà votre caprice les sept choeurs du paradis?\\n\\n--Mais c'est un peu de cela. Quand je veux entendre d'admirable musique,\\nvicomte, de la musique comme jamais l'oreille mortelle n'en a entendu,\\nje dors.\\n\\n--Eh bien, mais, vous êtes à merveille ici; dormez, mon cher comte,\\ndormez, l'Opéra n'a pas été inventé pour autre chose.\\n\\n--Non, en vérité, votre orchestre fait trop de bruit. Pour que je dorme\\ndu sommeil dont je vous parle, il me faut le calme et le silence, et\\npuis une certaine préparation....\\n\\n--Ah! le fameux haschich?\\n\\n--Justement, vicomte, quand vous voudrez entendre de la musique, venez\\nsouper avec moi.\\n\\n--Mais j'en ai déjà entendu en y allant déjeuner, dit Morcerf.\\n\\n--À Rome?\\n\\n--Oui.\\n\\n--Ah! c'était la guzla d'Haydée. Oui, la pauvre exilée s'amuse\\nquelquefois à me jouer des airs de son pays.»\\n\\nMorcerf n'insista pas davantage; de son côté, le comte se tut.\\n\\nEn ce moment la sonnette retentit.\\n\\n«Vous m'excusez? dit le comte en reprenant le chemin de sa loge.\\n\\n--Comment donc!\\n\\n--Emportez bien des choses pour la comtesse G... de la part de son\\nvampire.\\n\\n--Et à la baronne?\\n\\n--Dites-lui que j'aurai l'honneur, si elle le permet, d'aller lui\\nprésenter mes hommages dans la soirée.»\\n\\nLe troisième acte commença. Pendant le troisième acte le comte de\\nMorcerf vint, comme il l'avait promis, rejoindre Mme Danglars.\\n\\nLe comte n'était point un de ces hommes qui font révolution dans une\\nsalle; aussi personne ne s'aperçut-il de son arrivée que ceux dans la\\nloge desquels il venait prendre une place.\\n\\nMonte-Cristo le vit cependant, et un léger sourire effleura ses lèvres.\\n\\nQuant à Haydée, elle ne voyait rien tant que la toile était levée; comme\\ntoutes les natures primitives, elle adorait tout ce qui parle à\\nl'oreille et à la vue.\\n\\nLe troisième acte s'écoula comme d'habitude; Mlles Noblet, Julia et\\nLeroux exécutèrent leurs entrechats ordinaires; le prince de Grenade\\nfut défié par Robert-Mario; enfin ce majestueux roi que vous savez fit\\nle tour de la salle pour montrer son manteau de velours, en tenant sa\\nfille par la main; puis la toile tomba, et la salle se dégorgea aussitôt\\ndans le foyer et les corridors.\\n\\nLe comte sortit de sa loge, et un instant après apparut dans celle de la\\nbaronne Danglars.\\n\\nLa baronne ne put s'empêcher de jeter un cri de surprise légèrement mêlé\\nde joie.\\n\\n«Ah! venez donc, monsieur le comte! s'écria-t-elle, car, en vérité,\\nj'avais hâte de joindre mes grâces verbales aux remerciements écrits que\\nje vous ai déjà faits.\\n\\n--Oh! madame, dit le comte, vous vous rappelez encore cette misère? je\\nl'avais déjà oubliée, moi.\\n\\n--Oui, mais ce qu'on n'oublie pas, monsieur le comte, c'est que vous\\navez le lendemain sauvé ma bonne amie Mme de Villefort du danger que lui\\nfaisaient courir ces mêmes chevaux.\\n\\n--Cette fois encore, madame, je ne mérite pas vos remerciements; c'est\\nAli, mon Nubien, qui a eu le bonheur de rendre à Mme de Villefort cet\\néminent service.\\n\\n--Et est-ce aussi Ali, dit le comte de Morcerf, qui a tiré mon fils des\\nbandits romains?\\n\\n--Non, monsieur le comte, dit Monte-Cristo en serrant la main que le\\ngénéral lui tendait, non; cette fois je prends les remerciements pour\\nmon compte; mais vous me les avez déjà faits, je les ai déjà reçus, et,\\nen vérité, je suis honteux de vous retrouver encore si reconnaissant.\\nFaites-moi donc l'honneur, je vous prie, madame la baronne, de me\\nprésenter à mademoiselle votre fille.\\n\\n--Oh! vous êtes tout présenté, de nom du moins, car il y a deux ou trois\\njours que nous ne parlons que de vous. Eugénie, continua la baronne en\\nse retournant vers sa fille, monsieur le comte de Monte-Cristo!»\\n\\nLe comte s'inclina: Mlle Danglars fit un léger mouvement de tête.\\n\\n«Vous êtes là avec une admirable personne, monsieur le comte, dit\\nEugénie; est-ce votre fille?\\n\\n--Non, mademoiselle, dit Monte-Cristo étonné de cette extrême ingénuité\\nou de cet étonnant aplomb, c'est une pauvre Grecque dont je suis le\\ntuteur.\\n\\n--Et qui se nomme?...\\n\\n--Haydée, répondit Monte-Cristo.\\n\\n--Une Grecque! murmura le comte de Morcerf.\\n\\n--Oui, comte, dit Mme Danglars; et dites-moi si vous avez jamais vu à la\\ncour d'Ali-Tebelin, que vous avez si glorieusement servi, un aussi\\nadmirable costume que celui que nous avons là devant les yeux.\\n\\n--Ah! dit Monte-Cristo, vous avez servi à Janina, monsieur le comte?\\n\\n--J'ai été général-inspecteur des troupes du pacha, répondit Morcerf, et\\nmon peu de fortune, je ne le cache pas, vient des libéralités de\\nl'illustre chef albanais.\\n\\n--Regardez donc! insista Mme Danglars.\\n\\n--Où cela? balbutia Morcerf.\\n\\n--Tenez!» dit Monte-Cristo.\\n\\nEt, enveloppant le comte de son bras, il se pencha avec lui hors la\\nloge.\\n\\nEn ce moment, Haydée, qui cherchait le comte des yeux, aperçut sa tête\\npâle près de celle de M. de Morcerf, qu'il tenait embrassé.\\n\\nCette vue produisit sur la jeune fille l'effet de la tête de Méduse;\\nelle fit un mouvement en avant comme pour les dévorer tous deux du\\nregard, puis, presque aussitôt, elle se rejeta en arrière en poussant un\\nfaible cri, qui fut cependant entendu des personnes qui étaient les plus\\nproches d'elle et d'Ali, qui aussitôt ouvrit la porte.\\n\\n«Tiens, dit Eugénie, que vient-il donc d'arriver à votre pupille,\\nmonsieur le comte? On dirait qu'elle se trouve mal.\\n\\n--En effet, dit le comte, mais ne vous effrayez point, mademoiselle:\\nHaydée est très nerveuse et par conséquent très sensible aux odeurs: un\\nparfum qui lui est antipathique suffit pour la faire évanouir; mais,\\najouta le comte en tirant un flacon de sa poche, j'ai là le remède.»\\n\\nEt, après avoir salué la baronne et sa fille d'un seul et même salut, il\\néchangea une dernière poignée de main avec le comte et avec Debray, et\\nsortit de la loge de Mme Danglars.\\n\\nQuand il entra dans la sienne, Haydée était encore fort pâle; à peine\\nparut-il qu'elle lui saisit la main. Monte-Cristo s'aperçut que les\\nmains de la jeune fille étaient humides et glacées à la fois.\\n\\n«Avec qui donc causais-tu là, seigneur? demanda la jeune fille.\\n\\n--Mais, répondit Monte-Cristo, avec le comte de Morcerf, qui a été au\\nservice de ton illustre père, et qui avoue lui devoir sa fortune.\\n\\n--Ah! le misérable! s'écria Haydée, c'est lui qui l'a vendu aux Turcs;\\net cette fortune, c'est le prix de sa trahison. Ne savais-tu donc pas\\ncela, mon cher seigneur?\\n\\n--J'avais bien déjà entendu dire quelques mots de cette histoire en\\nÉpire, dit Monte-Cristo, mais j'en ignore les détails. Viens, ma fille,\\ntu me les donneras, ce doit être curieux.\\n\\n--Oh! oui, viens, viens; il me semble que je mourrais si je restais plus\\nlongtemps en face de cet homme.»\\n\\nEt Haydée, se levant vivement, s'enveloppa de son burnous de cachemire\\nblanc brodé de perles et de corail, et sortit vivement au moment où la\\ntoile se levait.\\n\\n«Voyez si cet homme fait rien comme un autre! dit la comtesse G... à\\nAlbert, qui était retourné près d'elle; il écoute religieusement le\\ntroisième acte de _Robert_, et il s'en va au moment où le quatrième va\\ncommencer.\",\n",
       " 'LIV': \"Quelques jours après cette rencontre, Albert de Morcerf vint faire\\nvisite au comte de Monte-Cristo dans sa maison des Champs-Élysées, qui\\navait déjà pris cette allure de palais, que le comte, grâce à son\\nimmense fortune, donnait à ses habitations même les plus passagères.\\n\\nIl venait lui renouveler les remerciements de Mme Danglars, que lui\\navait déjà apportés une lettre signée baronne Danglars, née Herminie de\\nServieux.\\n\\nAlbert était accompagné de Lucien Debray, lequel joignit aux paroles de\\nson ami quelques compliments qui n'étaient pas officiels sans doute,\\nmais dont, grâce à la finesse de son coup d'oeil, le comte ne pouvait\\nsuspecter la source.\\n\\nIl lui sembla même que Lucien venait le voir, mû par un double sentiment\\nde curiosité, et que la moitié de ce sentiment émanait de la rue de la\\nChaussée-d'Antin. En effet, il pouvait supposer, sans crainte de se\\ntromper, que Mme Danglars, ne pouvant connaître par ses propres yeux\\nl'intérieur d'un homme qui donnait des chevaux de trente mille francs,\\net qui allait à l'Opéra avec une esclave grecque portant un million de\\ndiamants, avait chargé les yeux par lesquels elle avait l'habitude de\\nvoir de lui donner des renseignements sur cet intérieur.\\n\\nMais le comte ne parut pas soupçonner la moindre corrélation entre la\\nvisite de Lucien et la curiosité de la baronne.\\n\\n«Vous êtes en rapports presque continuels avec le baron Danglars?\\ndemanda-t-il à Albert de Morcerf.\\n\\n--Mais oui, monsieur le comte; vous savez ce que je vous ai dit.\\n\\n--Cela tient donc toujours?\\n\\n--Plus que jamais, dit Lucien; c'est une affaire arrangée.»\\n\\nEt Lucien, jugeant sans doute que ce mot mêlé à la conversation lui\\ndonnait le droit d'y demeurer étranger, plaça son lorgnon d'écaille dans\\nson oeil, et mordant la pomme d'or de sa badine, se mit à faire le tour\\nde la chambre en examinant les armes et les tableaux.\\n\\n«Ah! dit Monte-Cristo; mais, à vous entendre, je n'avais pas cru à une\\nsi prompte solution.\\n\\n--Que voulez-vous? les choses marchent sans qu'on s'en doute; pendant\\nque vous ne songez pas à elles, elles songent à vous; et quand vous vous\\nretournez vous êtes étonné du chemin qu'elles ont fait. Mon père et M.\\nDanglars ont servi ensemble en Espagne, mon père dans l'armée, M.\\nDanglars dans les vivres. C'est là que mon père, ruiné par la\\nRévolution, et M. Danglars, qui n'avait, lui, jamais eu de patrimoine,\\nont jeté les fondements, mon père, de sa fortune politique et militaire,\\nqui est belle, M. Danglars, de sa fortune politique et financière, qui\\nest admirable.\\n\\n--Oui, en effet, dit Monte-Cristo, je crois que, pendant la visite que\\nje lui ai faite, M. Danglars m'a parlé de cela; et, continua-t-il en\\njetant un coup d'oeil sur Lucien, qui feuilletait un album, et elle est\\njolie, Mlle Eugénie? car je crois me rappeler que c'est Eugénie qu'elle\\ns'appelle.\\n\\n--Fort jolie, ou plutôt fort belle, répondit Albert, mais d'une beauté\\nque je n'apprécie pas. Je suis un indigne!\\n\\n--Vous en parlez déjà comme si vous étiez son mari!\\n\\n--Oh! fit Albert, en regardant autour de lui pour voir à son tour ce que\\nfaisait Lucien.\\n\\n--Savez-vous, dit Monte-Cristo en baissant la voix, que vous ne me\\nparaissez pas enthousiaste de ce mariage!\\n\\n--Mlle Danglars est trop riche pour moi, dit Morcerf, cela m'épouvante.\\n\\n--Bah! dit Monte-Cristo, voilà une belle raison; n'êtes-vous pas riche\\nvous-même?\\n\\n--Mon père a quelque chose comme une cinquantaine de mille livres de\\nrente, et m'en donnera peut-être dix ou douze en me mariant.\\n\\n--Le fait est que c'est modeste, dit le comte, à Paris surtout; mais\\ntout n'est pas dans la fortune en ce monde, et c'est bien quelque chose\\naussi qu'un beau nom et une haute position sociale. Votre nom est\\ncélèbre, votre position magnifique, et puis le comte de Morcerf est un\\nsoldat, et l'on aime à voir s'allier cette intégrité de Bayard à la\\npauvreté de Duguesclin; le désintéressement est le plus beau rayon de\\nsoleil auquel puisse reluire une noble épée. Moi, tout au contraire, je\\ntrouve cette union on ne peut plus sortable: Mlle Danglars vous\\nenrichira et vous l'anoblirez!»\\n\\nAlbert secoua la tête et demeura pensif.\\n\\n«Il y a encore autre chose, dit-il.\\n\\n--J'avoue, reprit Monte-Cristo, que j'ai peine à comprendre cette\\nrépugnance pour une jeune fille riche et belle.\\n\\n--Oh! mon Dieu! dit Morcerf, cette répugnance, si répugnance il y a, ne\\nvient pas toute de mon côté.\\n\\n--Mais de quel côté donc? car vous m'avez dit que votre père désirait ce\\nmariage.\\n\\n--Du côté de ma mère, et ma mère est un oeil prudent et sûr. Eh bien,\\nelle ne sourit pas à cette union; elle a je ne sais quelle prévention\\ncontre les Danglars.\\n\\n--Oh! dit le comte avec un ton un peu forcé, cela se conçoit; Mme la\\ncomtesse de Morcerf, qui est la distinction, l'aristocratie, la finesse\\nen personne, hésite un peu à toucher une main roturière, épaisse et\\nbrutale: c'est naturel.\\n\\n--Je ne sais si c'est cela, en effet, dit Albert; mais ce que je sais,\\nc'est qu'il me semble que ce mariage, s'il se fait, la rendra\\nmalheureuse. Déjà l'on devait s'assembler pour parler d'affaires il y a\\nsix semaines mais j'ai été tellement pris de migraines....\\n\\n--Réelles? dit le comte en souriant.\\n\\n--Oh! bien réelles, la peur sans doute... que l'on a remis le\\nrendez-vous à deux mois. Rien ne presse, vous comprenez; je n'ai pas\\nencore vingt et un ans, et Eugénie n'en a que dix-sept; mais les deux\\nmois expirent la semaine prochaine. Il faudra s'exécuter. Vous ne pouvez\\nvous imaginer, mon cher comte, combien je suis embarrassé... Ah! que\\nvous êtes heureux d'être libre!\\n\\n--Eh bien, mais soyez libre aussi; qui vous en empêche, je vous le\\ndemande un peu?\\n\\n--Oh! ce serait une trop grande déception pour mon père si je n'épouse\\npas Mlle Danglars.\\n\\n--Épousez-la alors, dit le comte avec un singulier mouvement d'épaules.\\n\\n--Oui, dit Morcerf; mais pour ma mère ce ne sera pas de la déception,\\nmais de la douleur.\\n\\n--Alors ne l'épousez pas, fit le comte.\\n\\n--Je verrai, j'essaierai, vous me donnerez un conseil, n'est-ce pas? et,\\ns'il vous est possible, vous me tirerez de cet embarras. Oh! pour ne pas\\nfaire de peine à mon excellente mère, je me brouillerais avec le comte,\\nje crois.»\\n\\nMonte-Cristo se détourna; il semblait ému.\\n\\n«Eh! dit-il à Debray, assis dans un fauteuil profond à l'extrémité du\\nsalon, et qui tenait de la main droite un crayon et de la gauche un\\ncarnet, que faites-vous donc, un croquis d'après le Poussin?\\n\\n--Moi? dit-il tranquillement, oh! bien oui! un croquis, j'aime trop la\\npeinture pour cela! Non pas, je fais tout l'opposé de la peinture, je\\nfais des chiffres.\\n\\n--Des chiffres?\\n\\n--Oui, je calcule; cela vous regarde indirectement, vicomte; je calcule\\nce que la maison Danglars a gagné sur la dernière hausse d'Haïti: de\\ndeux cent six le fonds est monté à quatre cent neuf en trois jours, et\\nle prudent banquier avait acheté beaucoup à deux cent six. Il a dû\\ngagner trois cent mille livres.\\n\\n--Ce n'est pas son meilleur coup, dit Morcerf; n'a-t-il pas gagné un\\nmillion cette année avec les bons d'Espagne?\\n\\n--Écoutez, mon cher, dit Lucien, voici M. le comte de Monte-Cristo qui\\nvous dira comme les Italiens:\\n\\n          _Danaro e santità_\\n          _Metà della metà_[2]\\n\\n\\n[Note 2: Argent et sainteté, Moitié de la moitié.]\\n\\nEt c'est encore beaucoup. Aussi, quand on me fait de pareilles\\nhistoires, je hausse les épaules.\\n\\n--Mais vous parliez d'Haïti? dit Monte-Cristo.\\n\\n--Oh! Haïti, c'est autre chose; Haïti, c'est l'écarté de l'agiotage\\nfrançais. On peut aimer la bouillotte, chérir le whist, raffoler du\\nboston, et se lasser cependant de tout cela; mais on en revient toujours\\nà l'écarté: c'est un hors-d'oeuvre. Ainsi M. Danglars a vendu hier à\\nquatre cent six et empoché trois cent mille francs; s'il eût attendu à\\naujourd'hui, le fonds retombait à deux cent cinq, et au lieu de gagner\\ntrois cent mille francs, il en perdait vingt ou vingt-cinq mille.\\n\\n--Et pourquoi le fonds est-il retombé de quatre cent neuf à deux cent\\ncinq? demanda Monte-Cristo. Je vous demande pardon, je suis fort\\nignorant de toutes ces intrigues de Bourse.\\n\\n--Parce que, répondit en riant Albert, les nouvelles se suivent et ne se\\nressemblent pas.\\n\\n--Ah! diable, fit le comte, M. Danglars joue à gagner ou à perdre trois\\ncent mille francs en un jour. Ah çà! mais il est donc énormément riche?\\n\\n--Ce n'est pas lui qui joue! s'écria vivement Lucien, c'est Mme\\nDanglars; elle est véritablement intrépide.\\n\\n--Mais vous qui êtes raisonnable, Lucien, et qui connaissez le peu de\\nstabilité des nouvelles, puisque vous êtes à la source, vous devriez\\nl'empêcher, dit Morcerf avec un sourire.\\n\\n--Comment le pourrais-je, si son mari ne réussit pas? demanda Lucien.\\nVous connaissez le caractère de la baronne, personne n'a d'influence sur\\nelle, et elle ne fait absolument que ce qu'elle veut.\\n\\n--Oh! si j'étais à votre place! dit Albert.\\n\\n--Eh bien!\\n\\n--Je la guérirais, moi; ce serait un service à rendre à son futur\\ngendre.\\n\\n--Comment cela?\\n\\n--Ah pardieu! c'est bien facile, je lui donnerais une leçon.\\n\\n--Une leçon?\\n\\n--Oui. Votre position de secrétaire du ministre vous donne une grande\\nautorité pour les nouvelles; vous n'ouvrez pas la bouche que les agents\\nde change ne sténographient au plus vite vos paroles; faites-lui perdre\\nune centaine de mille francs coup sur coup, et cela la rendra prudente.\\n\\n--Je ne comprends pas, balbutia Lucien.\\n\\n--C'est cependant limpide, répondit le jeune homme avec une naïveté qui\\nn'avait rien d'affecté; annoncez-lui un beau matin quelque chose\\nd'inouï, une nouvelle télégraphique que vous seul puissiez savoir; que\\nHenri IV, par exemple, a été vu hier chez Gabrielle; cela fera monter\\nles fonds, elle établira son coup de bourse là-dessus, et elle perdra\\ncertainement lorsque Beauchamp écrira le lendemain dans son journal:\\n«C'est à tort que les gens bien informés prétendent que le roi Henri IV\\na été vu avant-hier chez Gabrielle, ce fait est complètement inexact; le\\nroi Henri IV n'a pas quitté le pont Neuf.»\\n\\nLucien se mit à rire du bout des lèvres. Monte-Cristo, quoique\\nindifférent en apparence, n'avait pas perdu un mot de cet entretien, et\\nson oeil perçant avait même cru lire un secret dans l'embarras du\\nsecrétaire intime.\\n\\nIl résulta de cet embarras de Lucien, qui avait complètement échappé à\\nAlbert, que Lucien abrégea sa visite.\\n\\nIl se sentait évidemment mal à l'aise. Le comte lui dit en le\\nreconduisant quelques mots à voix basse auxquels il répondit:\\n\\n«Bien volontiers, monsieur le comte, j'accepte.»\\n\\nLe comte revint au jeune de Morcerf.\\n\\n«Ne pensez-vous pas, en y réfléchissant, lui dit-il, que vous avez eu\\ntort de parler comme vous l'avez fait de votre belle-mère devant M.\\nDebray?\\n\\n--Tenez, comte, dit Morcerf, je vous en prie, ne dites pas d'avance ce\\nmot-là.\\n\\n--Vraiment, et sans exagération, la comtesse est à ce point contraire à\\nce mariage?\\n\\n--À ce point que la baronne vient rarement à la maison, et que ma mère,\\nje crois, n'a pas été deux fois dans sa vie chez madame Danglars.\\n\\n--Alors, dit le comte, me voilà enhardi à vous parler à coeur ouvert: M.\\nDanglars est mon banquier, M. de Villefort m'a comblé de politesse en\\nremerciement d'un service qu'un heureux hasard m'a mis à même de lui\\nrendre. Je devine sous tout cela une avalanche de dîners et de raouts.\\nOr, pour ne pas paraître brocher fastueusement sur le tout, et même pour\\navoir le mérite de prendre les devants, si vous voulez, j'ai projeté de\\nréunir dans ma maison de campagne d'Auteuil M. et Mme Danglars, M. et\\nMme de Villefort. Si je vous invite à ce dîner, ainsi que M. le comte et\\nMme la comtesse de Morcerf, cela n'aura-t-il pas l'air d'une espèce de\\nrendez-vous matrimonial, ou du moins Mme la comtesse de Morcerf\\nn'envisagera-t-elle point la chose ainsi, surtout si M. le baron\\nDanglars me fait l'honneur d'amener sa fille? Alors votre mère me\\nprendra en horreur, et je ne veux aucunement de cela, moi; je tiens, au\\ncontraire, et dites-le-lui toutes les fois que l'occasion s'en\\nprésentera, à rester au mieux dans son esprit.\\n\\n--Ma foi, comte, dit Morcerf, je vous remercie d'y mettre avec moi cette\\nfranchise, et j'accepte l'exclusion que vous me proposez. Vous dites que\\nvous tenez à rester au mieux dans l'esprit de ma mère, où vous êtes déjà\\nà merveille.\\n\\n--Vous croyez? fit Monte-Cristo avec intérêt.\\n\\n--Oh! j'en suis sûr. Quand vous nous avez quittés l'autre jour, nous\\navons causé une heure de vous mais j'en reviens à ce que nous disions.\\nEh bien, si ma mère pouvait savoir cette attention de votre part, et je\\nme hasarderai à la lui dire, je suis sûr qu'elle vous en serait on ne\\npeut plus reconnaissante. Il est vrai que de son côté, mon père serait\\nfurieux.»\\n\\nLe comte se mit à rire.\\n\\n«Eh bien, dit-il à Morcerf, vous voilà prévenu. Mais j'y pense, il n'y\\naura pas que votre père qui sera furieux; M. et Mme Danglars vont me\\nconsidérer comme un homme de fort mauvaise façon. Ils savent que je vous\\nvois avec une certaine intimité, que vous êtes même ma plus ancienne\\nconnaissance parisienne et ils ne vous trouveront pas chez moi; ils me\\ndemanderont pourquoi je ne vous ai pas invité. Songez au moins à vous\\nmunir d'un engagement antérieur qui ait quelque apparence de\\nprobabilité, et dont vous me ferez part au moyen d'un petit mot. Vous le\\nsavez, avec les banquiers les écrits sont seuls valables.\\n\\n--Je ferai mieux que cela, monsieur le comte, dit Albert. Ma mère veut\\naller respirer l'air de la mer. À quel jour est fixé votre dîner?\\n\\n--À samedi.\\n\\n--Nous sommes à mardi, bien; demain soir nous partons; après-demain nous\\nserons au Tréport. Savez-vous, monsieur le comte, que vous êtes un homme\\ncharmant de mettre ainsi les gens à leur aise!\\n\\n--Moi! en vérité vous me tenez pour plus que je ne vaux; je désire vous\\nêtre agréable, voilà tout.\\n\\n--Quel jour avez-vous fait vos invitations?\\n\\n--Aujourd'hui même.\\n\\n--Bien! Je cours chez M. Danglars, je lui annonce que nous quittons\\nParis demain, ma mère et moi. Je ne vous ai pas vu; par conséquent je ne\\nsais rien de votre dîner.\\n\\n--Fou que vous êtes! et M. Debray, qui vient de vous voir chez moi, lui!\\n\\n--Ah! c'est juste.\\n\\n--Au contraire, je vous ai vu et invité ici sans cérémonie, et vous\\nm'avez tout naïvement répondu que vous ne pouviez pas être mon convive,\\nparce que vous partiez pour le Tréport.\\n\\n--Eh bien, voilà qui est conclu. Mais vous, viendrez-vous voir ma mère\\navant demain?\\n\\n--Avant demain, c'est difficile; puis je tomberais au milieu de vos\\npréparatifs de départ.\\n\\n--Eh bien, faites mieux que cela; vous n'étiez qu'un homme charmant,\\nvous serez un homme adorable.\\n\\n--Que faut-il que je fasse pour arriver à cette sublimité?\\n\\n--Ce qu'il faut que vous fassiez?\\n\\n--Je le demande.\\n\\n--Vous êtes aujourd'hui libre comme l'air; venez dîner avec moi: nous\\nserons en petit comité, vous, ma mère et moi seulement. Vous avez à\\npeine aperçu ma mère; mais vous la verrez de près. C'est une femme fort\\nremarquable, et je ne regrette qu'une chose: c'est que sa pareille\\nn'existe pas avec vingt ans de moins; il y aurait bientôt, je vous le\\njure, une comtesse et une vicomtesse de Morcerf. Quant à mon père, vous\\nne le trouverez pas: il est de commission ce soir et dîne chez le grand\\nréférendaire. Venez, nous causerons voyages. Vous qui avez vu le monde\\ntout entier, vous nous raconterez vos aventures; vous nous direz\\nl'histoire de cette belle Grecque qui était l'autre soir avec vous à\\nl'Opéra, que vous appelez votre esclave et que vous traitez comme une\\nprincesse. Nous parlerons italien, espagnol. Voyons, acceptez; ma mère\\nvous remerciera.\\n\\n--Mille grâces, dit le comte; l'invitation est des plus gracieuses, et\\nje regrette vivement de ne pouvoir l'accepter. Je ne suis pas libre\\ncomme vous le pensiez, et j'ai au contraire un rendez-vous des plus\\nimportants.\\n\\n--Ah! prenez garde; vous m'avez appris tout à l'heure comment, en fait\\nde dîner, on se décharge d'une chose désagréable. Il me faut une preuve.\\nJe ne suis heureusement pas banquier comme M. Danglars; mais je suis, je\\nvous en préviens, aussi incrédule que lui.\\n\\n--Aussi vais-je vous la donner», dit le comte.\\n\\nEt il sonna.\\n\\n«Hum! fit Morcerf, voilà déjà deux fois que vous refusez de dîner avec\\nma mère. C'est un parti pris, comte.»\\n\\nMonte-Cristo tressaillit.\\n\\n«Oh! vous ne le croyez pas, dit-il; d'ailleurs voici ma preuve qui\\nvient.»\\n\\nBaptistin entra et se tint sur la porte debout et attendant.\\n\\n«Je n'étais pas prévenu de votre visite, n'est-ce pas?\\n\\n--Dame! vous êtes un homme si extraordinaire que je n'en répondrais pas.\\n\\n\\n--Je ne pouvais point deviner que vous m'inviteriez à dîner, au moins.\\n\\n--Oh! quant à cela, c'est probable.\\n\\n--Eh bien, écoutez, Baptistin... que vous ai-je dit ce matin quand je\\nvous ai appelé dans mon cabinet de travail?\\n\\n--De faire fermer la porte de M. le comte une fois cinq heures sonnées.\\n\\n--Ensuite?\\n\\n--Oh! monsieur le comte... dit Albert.\\n\\n--Non, non, je veux absolument me débarrasser de cette réputation\\nmystérieuse que vous m'avez faite, mon cher vicomte. Il est trop\\ndifficile de jouer éternellement le Manfred. Je veux vivre dans une\\nmaison de verre. Ensuite.... Continuez, Baptistin.\\n\\n--Ensuite, de ne recevoir que M. le major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti et son\\nfils.\\n\\n--Vous entendez, M. le major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti, un homme de la plus\\nvieille noblesse d'Italie et dont Dante a pris la peine d'être le\\nd'Hozier.... Vous vous rappelez ou vous ne vous rappelez pas, dans le\\ndixième chant de l'Enfer; de plus, son fils, un charmant jeune homme de\\nvotre âge à peu près, vicomte, portant le même titre que vous, et qui\\nfait son entrée dans le monde parisien avec les millions de son père. Le\\nmajor m'amène ce soir son fils Andrea, le contino, comme nous disons en\\nItalie. Il me le confie. Je le pousserai s'il a quelque mérite. Vous\\nm'aiderez, n'est-ce pas?\\n\\n--Sans doute! C'est donc un ancien ami à vous que ce major Cavalcanti?\\ndemanda Albert.\\n\\n--Pas du tout, c'est un digne seigneur, très poli, très modeste, très\\ndiscret, comme il y en a une foule en Italie, des descendants très\\ndescendus des vieilles familles. Je l'ai vu plusieurs fois, soit à\\nFlorence, soit à Bologne, soit à Lucques, et il m'a prévenu de son\\narrivée. Les connaissances de voyage sont exigeantes: elles réclament de\\nvous, en tout lieu, l'amitié qu'on leur a témoignée une fois par hasard;\\ncomme si l'homme civilisé, qui sait vivre une heure avec n'importe qui,\\nn'avait pas toujours son arrière-pensée! Ce bon major Cavalcanti va\\nrevoir Paris, qu'il n'a vu qu'en passant, sous l'Empire, en allant se\\nfaire geler à Moscou. Je lui donnerai un bon dîner, il me laissera son\\nfils; je lui promettrai de veiller sur lui; je lui laisserai faire\\ntoutes les folies qu'il lui conviendra de faire, et nous serons\\nquittes.\\n\\n--À merveille! dit Albert, et je vois que vous êtes un précieux mentor.\\nAdieu donc, nous serons de retour dimanche. À propos, j'ai reçu des\\nnouvelles de Franz.\\n\\n--Ah! vraiment! dit Monte-Cristo; et se plaît-il toujours en Italie?\\n\\n--Je pense que oui; cependant il vous y regrette. Il dit que vous étiez\\nle soleil de Rome, et que sans vous il y fait gris. Je ne sais même pas\\ns'il ne va point jusqu'à dire qu'il y pleut.\\n\\n--Il est donc revenu sur mon compte, votre ami Franz?\\n\\n--Au contraire, il persiste à vous croire fantastique au premier chef;\\nvoilà pourquoi il vous regrette.\\n\\n--Charmant jeune homme! dit Monte-Cristo, et pour lequel je me suis\\nsenti une vive sympathie le premier soir où je l'ai vu cherchant un\\nsouper quelconque, et il a bien voulu accepter le mien. C'est, je crois,\\nle fils du général d'Épinay?\\n\\n--Justement.\\n\\n--Le même qui a été si misérablement assassiné en 1815?\\n\\n--Par les bonapartistes.\\n\\n--C'est cela! Ma foi, je l'aime! N'y a-t-il pas pour lui aussi des\\nprojets de mariage?\\n\\n--Oui, il doit épouser Mlle de Villefort.\\n\\n--C'est vrai?\\n\\n--Comme moi je dois épouser Mlle Danglars, reprit Albert en riant.\\n\\n--Vous riez....\\n\\n--Oui.\\n\\n--Pourquoi riez-vous?\\n\\n--Je ris parce qu'il me semble voir de ce côté-là autant de sympathie\\npour le mariage qu'il y en a d'un autre côté entre Mlle Danglars et moi.\\nMais vraiment, mon cher comte, nous causons de femmes comme les femmes\\ncausent d'hommes; c'est impardonnable!»\\n\\nAlbert se leva.\\n\\n«Vous vous en allez?\\n\\n--La question est bonne! il y a deux heures que je vous assomme, et vous\\navez la politesse de me demander si je m'en vais! En vérité, comte, vous\\nêtes l'homme le plus poli de la terre! Et vos domestiques, comme ils\\nsont dressés! M. Baptistin surtout! je n'ai jamais pu en avoir un comme\\ncela. Les miens semblent tous prendre exemple sur ceux du\\nThéâtre-Français, qui justement parce qu'ils n'ont qu'un mot à dire,\\nviennent toujours le dire sur la rampe. Ainsi, si vous vous défaites de\\nM. Baptistin, je vous demande la préférence.\\n\\n--C'est dit, vicomte.\\n\\n--Ce n'est pas tout, attendez: faites bien mes compliments à votre\\ndiscret Lucquois, au seigneur Cavalcante dei Cavalcanti; et si par\\nhasard il tenait à établir son fils, trouvez-lui une femme bien riche,\\nbien noble, du chef de sa mère, du moins, et bien baronne du chef de son\\npère. Je vous y aiderai, moi.\\n\\n--Oh! oh! répondit Monte-Cristo, en vérité, vous en êtes là?\\n\\n--Oui.\\n\\n--Ma foi, il ne faut jurer de rien.\\n\\n--Ah! comte, s'écria Morcerf, quel service vous me rendriez, et comme je\\nvous aimerais cent fois davantage encore si, grâce à vous, je restais\\ngarçon, ne fût-ce que dix ans.\\n\\n--Tout est possible», répondit gravement Monte-Cristo.\\n\\nEt prenant congé d'Albert, il rentra chez lui et frappa trois fois sur\\nson timbre.\\n\\nBertuccio parut.\\n\\n«Monsieur Bertuccio, dit-il, vous saurez que je reçois samedi dans ma\\nmaison d'Auteuil.»\\n\\nBertuccio eut un léger frisson.\\n\\n«Bien, monsieur, dit-il.\\n\\n--J'ai besoin de vous, continua le comte, pour que tout soit préparé\\nconvenablement. Cette maison est fort belle, ou du moins peut être fort\\nbelle.\\n\\n--Il faudrait tout changer pour en arriver là, monsieur le comte, car\\nles tentures ont vieilli.\\n\\n--Changez donc tout, à l'exception d'une seule, celle de la chambre à\\ncoucher de damas rouge: vous la laisserez même absolument telle qu'elle\\nest.»\\n\\nBertuccio s'inclina.\\n\\n«Vous ne toucherez pas au jardin non plus; mais de la cour, par exemple,\\nfaites-en tout ce que vous voudrez; il me sera même agréable qu'on ne la\\npuisse pas reconnaître.\\n\\n--Je ferai tout mon possible pour que monsieur le comte soit content; je\\nserais plus rassuré cependant si monsieur le comte me voulait dire ses\\nintentions pour le dîner.\\n\\n--En vérité, mon cher monsieur Bertuccio, dit le comte, depuis que vous\\nêtes à Paris je vous trouve dépaysé, trembleur; mais vous ne me\\nconnaissez donc plus?\\n\\n--Mais enfin Son Excellence pourrait me dire qui elle reçoit!\\n\\n--Je n'en sais rien encore, et vous n'avez pas besoin de le savoir non\\nplus. Lucullus dîne chez Lucullus, voilà tout.»\\n\\nBertuccio s'inclina et sortit.\",\n",
       " 'LV': \"Ni le comte ni Baptistin n'avaient menti en annonçant à Morcerf cette\\nvisite du major Lucquois, qui servait à Monte-Cristo de prétexte pour\\nrefuser le dîner qui lui était offert.\\n\\nSept heures venaient de sonner, et M. Bertuccio, selon l'ordre qu'il en\\navait reçu, était parti depuis deux heures pour Auteuil, lorsqu'un\\nfiacre s'arrêta à la porte de l'hôtel, et sembla s'enfuir tout honteux\\naussitôt qu'il eut déposé près de la grille un homme de cinquante-deux\\nans environ, vêtu d'une de ces redingotes vertes à brandebourgs noirs\\ndont l'espèce est impérissable, à ce qu'il paraît, en Europe. Un large\\npantalon de drap bleu, une botte encore assez propre, quoique d'un\\nvernis incertain et un peu trop épaisse de semelle, des gants de daim,\\nun chapeau se rapprochant pour la forme d'un chapeau de gendarme, un col\\nnoir, brodé d'un liséré blanc, qui, si son propriétaire ne l'eût porté\\nde sa pleine et entière volonté, eût pu passer pour un carcan: tel était\\nle costume pittoresque sous lequel se présenta le personnage qui sonna à\\nla grille en demandant si ce n'était point au n° 30 de l'avenue des\\nChamps-Élysées que demeurait M. le comte de Monte-Cristo, et qui, sur la\\nréponse affirmative du concierge, entra, ferma la porte derrière lui et\\nse dirigea vers le perron.\\n\\nLa tête petite et anguleuse de cet homme, ses cheveux blanchissants, sa\\nmoustache épaisse et grise le firent reconnaître par Baptistin, qui\\navait l'exact signalement du visiteur et qui l'attendait au bas du\\nvestibule. Aussi, à peine eut-il prononcé son nom devant le serviteur\\nintelligent, que Monte-Cristo était prévenu de son arrivée.\\n\\nOn introduisit l'étranger dans le salon le plus simple. Le comte l'y\\nattendait et alla au-devant de lui d'un air riant.\\n\\n«Ah! cher monsieur, dit-il, soyez le bienvenu. Je vous attendais.\\n\\n--Vraiment, dit le Lucquois, Votre Excellence m'attendait.\\n\\n--Oui, j'avais été prévenu de votre arrivée pour aujourd'hui à sept\\nheures.\\n\\n--De mon arrivée? Ainsi vous étiez prévenu?\\n\\n--Parfaitement.\\n\\n--Ah! tant mieux! Je craignais, je l'avoue, que l'on n'eût oublié cette\\npetite précaution.\\n\\n--Laquelle?\\n\\n--De vous prévenir.\\n\\n--Oh! non pas!\\n\\n--Mais vous êtes sûr de ne pas vous tromper?\\n\\n--J'en suis sûr.\\n\\n--C'est bien moi que Votre Excellence attendait aujourd'hui à sept\\nheures?\\n\\n--C'est bien vous. D'ailleurs, vérifions.\\n\\n--Oh! si vous m'attendiez, dit le Lucquois, ce n'est pas la peine.\\n\\n--Si fait! si fait!» dit Monte-Cristo.\\n\\nLe Lucquois parut légèrement inquiet.\\n\\n«Voyons, dit Monte-Cristo, n'êtes-vous pas monsieur le marquis\\nBartolomeo Cavalcanti?\\n\\n--Bartolomeo Cavalcanti, répéta le Lucquois joyeux, c'est bien cela.\\n\\n--Ex-major au service d'Autriche?\\n\\n--Était-ce major que j'étais? demanda timidement le vieux militaire.\\n\\n--Oui, dit Monte-Cristo, c'était major. C'est le nom que l'on donne en\\nFrance au grade que vous occupiez en Italie.\\n\\n--Bon, dit le Lucquois, je ne demande pas mieux, moi, vous comprenez....\\n\\n--D'ailleurs, vous ne venez pas ici de votre propre mouvement, reprit\\nMonte-Cristo.\\n\\n--Oh! bien certainement.\\n\\n--Vous m'êtes adressé par quelqu'un.\\n\\n--Oui.\\n\\n--Par cet excellent abbé Busoni?\\n\\n--C'est cela! s'écria le major joyeux.\\n\\n--Et vous avez une lettre?\\n\\n--La voilà.\\n\\n--Eh pardieu! vous voyez bien. Donnez donc.»\\n\\nEt Monte-Cristo prit la lettre qu'il ouvrit et qu'il lut.\\n\\nLe major regardait le comte avec de gros yeux étonnés qui se portaient\\ncurieusement sur chaque partie de l'appartement, mais qui revenaient\\ninvariablement à son propriétaire.\\n\\n«C'est bien cela... ce cher abbé, «le major Cavalcanti, un digne\\npraticien de Lucques, descendant des Cavalcanti de Florence, continua\\nMonte-Cristo tout en lisant, jouissant d'une fortune d'un demi-million\\nde revenu.»\\n\\nMonte-Cristo leva les yeux de dessus le papier et salua.\\n\\n«D'un demi-million, dit-il; peste! mon cher monsieur Cavalcanti.\\n\\n--Y a-t-il un demi-million? demanda le Lucquois.\\n\\n--En toutes lettres; et cela doit être, l'abbé Busoni est l'homme qui\\nconnaît le mieux toutes les grandes fortunes de l'Europe.\\n\\n--Va pour un demi-million, dit le Lucquois; mais, ma parole d'honneur,\\nje ne croyais pas que cela montât si haut.\\n\\n--Parce que vous avez un intendant qui vous vole; que voulez-vous, cher\\nmonsieur Cavalcanti, il faut bien passer par là!\\n\\n--Vous venez de m'éclairer, dit gravement le Lucquois, je mettrai le\\ndrôle à la porte.»\\n\\nMonte-Cristo continua:\\n\\n--«Et auquel il ne manquerait qu'une chose pour être heureux».\\n\\n--Oh! mon Dieu, oui! une seule, dit le Lucquois avec un soupir.\\n\\n--«De retrouver un fils adoré.»\\n\\n--Un fils adoré!\\n\\n--«Enlevé dans sa jeunesse, soit par un ennemi de sa noble famille, soit\\npar des Bohémiens.»\\n\\n--À l'âge de cinq ans, monsieur, dit le Lucquois avec un profond soupir\\net en levant les yeux au ciel.\\n\\n--Pauvre père!» dit Monte-Cristo.\\n\\nLe comte continua:\\n\\n--«Je lui rends l'espoir, je lui rends la vie, monsieur le comte, en lui\\nannonçant que ce fils, que depuis quinze ans il cherche vainement, vous\\npouvez le lui faire retrouver.»\\n\\nLe Lucquois regarda Monte-Cristo avec une indéfinissable expression\\nd'inquiétude.\\n\\n«Je le puis», répondit Monte-Cristo.\\n\\nLe major se redressa.\\n\\n«Ah! ah! dit-il, la lettre était donc vraie jusqu'au bout?\\n\\n--En aviez-vous douté, cher monsieur Bartolomeo?\\n\\n--Non pas, jamais! Comment donc! un homme grave, un homme revêtu d'un\\ncaractère religieux comme l'abbé Busoni, ne se serait pas permis une\\nplaisanterie pareille; mais vous n'avez pas tout lu, Excellence.\\n\\n--Ah! c'est vrai, dit Monte-Cristo, il y a un _post-scriptum_.\\n\\n--Oui, répéta le Lucquois... il...y... a... un... _post-scriptum_.\\n\\n--«Pour ne point causer au major Cavalcanti l'embarras de déplacer des\\nfonds chez son banquier, je lui envoie une traite de deux mille francs\\npour ses frais de voyage, et le crédit sur vous de la somme de\\nquarante-huit mille francs que vous restez me redevoir.»\\n\\nLe major suivit des yeux ce _post-scriptum_ avec une visible anxiété.\\n\\n«Bon! se contenta de dire le comte.\\n\\n--Il a dit bon, murmura le Lucquois. Ainsi... monsieur... reprit-il.\\n\\n--Ainsi?... demanda Monte-Cristo.\\n\\n--Ainsi, le _post-scriptum_...\\n\\n--Eh bien, le _post-scriptum_?...\\n\\n--Est accueilli par vous aussi favorablement que le reste de la lettre?\\n\\n--Certainement. Nous sommes en compte, l'abbé Busoni et moi; je ne sais\\npas si c'est quarante-huit mille livres précisément que je reste lui\\nredevoir, nous n'en sommes pas entre nous à quelques billets de banque.\\nAh çà! vous attachiez donc une si grande importance à ce post-scriptum,\\ncher monsieur Cavalcanti?\\n\\n--Je vous avouerai, répondit le Lucquois, que plein de confiance dans la\\nsignature de l'abbé Busoni, je ne m'étais pas muni d'autres fonds; de\\nsorte que si cette ressource m'eût manqué, je me serais trouvé fort\\nembarrassé à Paris.\\n\\n--Est-ce qu'un homme comme vous est embarrassé quelque part? dit\\nMonte-Cristo; allons donc!\\n\\n--Dame! ne connaissant personne, fit le Lucquois.\\n\\n--Mais on vous connaît, vous.\\n\\n--Oui, l'on me connaît, de sorte que....\\n\\n--Achevez, cher monsieur Cavalcanti!\\n\\n--De sorte que vous me remettrez ces quarante-huit mille livres?\\n\\n--À votre première réquisition.»\\n\\nLe major roulait de gros yeux ébahis.\\n\\n«Mais asseyez-vous donc, dit Monte-Cristo: en vérité, je ne sais ce que\\nje fais... je vous tiens debout depuis un quart d'heure.\\n\\n--Ne faites pas attention.»\\n\\nLe major tira un fauteuil et s'assit.\\n\\n«Maintenant, dit le comte, voulez-vous prendre quelque chose; un verre\\nde xérès, de porto, d'alicante?\\n\\n--D'alicante, puisque vous le voulez bien, c'est mon vin de\\nprédilection.\\n\\n--J'en ai d'excellent. Avec un biscuit, n'est-ce pas?\\n\\n--Avec un biscuit, puisque vous m'y forcez.»\\n\\nMonte-Cristo sonna; Baptistin parut.\\n\\nLe comte s'avança vers lui.\\n\\n«Eh bien?... demanda-t-il tout bas.\\n\\n--Le jeune homme est là, répondit le valet de chambre sur le même ton.\\n\\n--Bien; où l'avez-vous fait entrer?\\n\\n--Dans le salon bleu, comme l'avait ordonné Son Excellence.\\n\\n--À merveille. Apportez du vin d'Alicante et des biscuits.»\\n\\nBaptistin sortit.\\n\\n«En vérité, dit le Lucquois, je vous donne une peine qui me remplit de\\nconfusion.\\n\\n--Allons donc!» dit Monte-Cristo.\\n\\nBaptistin rentra avec les verres, le vin et les biscuits.\\n\\nLe comte emplit un verre et versa dans le second quelques gouttes\\nseulement du rubis liquide que contenait la bouteille, toute couverte de\\ntoiles d'araignée et de tous les autres signes qui indiquent la\\nvieillesse du vin bien plus sûrement que ne le font les rides pour\\nl'homme.\\n\\nLe major ne se trompa point au partage, il prit le verre plein et un\\nbiscuit. Le comte ordonna à Baptistin de poser le plateau à la portée de\\nla main de son hôte, qui commença par goûter l'alicante du bout de ses\\nlèvres, fit une grimace de satisfaction, et introduisit délicatement le\\nbiscuit dans le verre.\\n\\n«Ainsi, monsieur, dit Monte-Cristo, vous habitiez Lucques, vous étiez\\nriche, vous êtes noble, vous jouissiez de la considération générale,\\nvous aviez tout ce qui peut rendre un homme heureux.\\n\\n--Tout, Excellence, dit le major en engloutissant son biscuit, tout\\nabsolument.\\n\\n--Et il ne manquait qu'une chose à votre bonheur?\\n\\n--Qu'une seule, dit le Lucquois.\\n\\n--C'était de retrouver votre enfant?\\n\\n--Ah! fit le major en prenant un second biscuit; mais aussi cela me\\nmanquait bien.»\\n\\nLe digne Lucquois leva les yeux et tenta un effort pour soupirer.\\n\\n«Maintenant, voyons, cher monsieur Cavalcanti, dit Monte-Cristo,\\nqu'était-ce que ce fils tant regretté? car on m'avait dit, à moi, que\\nvous étiez resté célibataire.\\n\\n--On le croyait, monsieur, dit le major, et moi-même....\\n\\n--Oui, reprit Monte-Cristo, et vous-même aviez accrédité ce bruit. Un\\npéché de jeunesse que vous vouliez cacher à tous les yeux.»\\n\\nLe Lucquois se redressa, prit son air le plus calme et le plus digne, en\\nmême temps qu'il baissait modestement les yeux, soit pour assurer sa\\ncontenance, soit pour aider à son imagination, tout en regardant en\\ndessous le comte, dont le sourire stéréotypé sur les lèvres annonçait\\ntoujours la même bienveillante curiosité.\\n\\n«Oui, monsieur, dit-il, je voulais cacher cette faute à tous les yeux.»\\n\\n--Pas pour vous, dit Monte-Cristo, car un homme est au-dessus de ces\\nchoses-là.\\n\\n--Oh! non, pas pour moi certainement, dit le major avec un sourire et en\\nhochant la tête.\\n\\n--Mais pour sa mère, dit le comte.\\n\\n--Pour sa mère! s'écria le Lucquois en prenant un troisième biscuit,\\npour sa pauvre mère!\\n\\n--Buvez donc, cher monsieur Cavalcanti, dit Monte-Cristo en versant au\\nLucquois un second verre d'alicante; l'émotion vous étouffe.\\n\\n--Pour sa pauvre mère! murmura le Lucquois en essayant si la puissance\\nde la volonté ne pourrait pas en agissant sur la glande lacrymale,\\nmouiller le coin de son oeil d'une fausse larme.\\n\\n--Qui appartenait à l'une des premières familles d'Italie, je crois?\\n\\n--Patricienne de Fiesole, monsieur le comte, patricienne de Fiesole!\\n\\n--Et se nommant?\\n\\n--Vous désirez savoir son nom?\\n\\n--Oh! mon Dieu! dit Monte-Cristo, c'est inutile que vous me le disiez,\\nje le connais.\\n\\n--Monsieur le comte sait tout, dit le Lucquois en s'inclinant.\\n\\n--Olivia Corsinari, n'est-ce pas?\\n\\n--Olivia Corsinari.\\n\\n--Marquise?\\n\\n--Marquise.\\n\\n--Et vous avez fini par l'épouser cependant, malgré les oppositions de\\nla famille?\\n\\n--Mon Dieu! oui, j'ai fini par là.\\n\\n--Et, reprit Monte-Cristo, vous apportez vos papiers bien en règle?\\n\\n--Quels papiers? demanda le Lucquois.\\n\\n--Mais votre acte de mariage avec Olivia Corsinari, et l'acte de\\nnaissance de l'enfant.\\n\\n--L'acte de naissance de l'enfant?\\n\\n--L'acte de naissance d'Andrea Cavalcanti, de votre fils; ne\\ns'appelle-t-il pas Andrea?\\n\\n--Je crois que oui, dit le Lucquois.\\n\\n--Comment! vous le croyez?\\n\\n--Dame! je n'ose pas affirmer, il y a si longtemps qu'il est perdu.\\n\\n--C'est juste, dit Monte-Cristo. Enfin vous avez tous ces papiers?\\n\\n--Monsieur le comte, c'est avec regret que je vous annonce que, n'étant\\npas prévenu de me munir de ces pièces, j'ai négligé de les prendre avec\\nmoi.\\n\\n--Ah! diable, fit Monte-Cristo.\\n\\n--Étaient-elles donc tout à fait nécessaires?\\n\\n--Indispensables!»\\n\\nLucquois se gratta le front.\\n\\n«Ah! _per Bacco_! dit-il, indispensables!\\n\\n--Sans doute; si l'on allait élever ici quelque doute sur la validité de\\nvotre mariage, sur la légitimité de votre enfant!\\n\\n--C'est juste, dit le Lucquois, on pourrait élever des doutes.\\n\\n--Ce serait fâcheux pour ce jeune homme.\\n\\n--Ce serait fatal.\\n\\n--Cela pourrait lui faire manquer quelque magnifique mariage.\\n\\n--_O peccato_!\\n\\n--En France, vous comprenez, on est sévère; il ne suffit pas, comme en\\nItalie, d'aller trouver un prêtre et de lui dire: «Nous nous aimons,\\nunissez-nous.» Il y a mariage civil en France, et, pour se marier\\ncivilement, il faut des pièces qui constatent l'identité.\\n\\n--Voilà le malheur: ces papiers, je ne les ai pas.\\n\\n--Heureusement que je les ai, moi, dit Monte-Cristo.\\n\\n--Vous?\\n\\n--Oui?\\n\\n--Vous les avez?\\n\\n--Je les ai.\\n\\n--Ah! par exemple, dit le Lucquois, qui, voyant le but de son voyage\\nmanqué par l'absence de ses papiers, craignait que cet oubli n'amenât\\nquelque difficulté au sujet des quarante-huit mille livres; ah! par\\nexemple, voilà un bonheur! Oui, reprit-il, voilà un bonheur, car je n'y\\neusse pas songé, moi.\\n\\n--Pardieu! je crois bien, on ne songe pas à tout. Mais heureusement\\nl'abbé Busoni y a songé pour vous.\\n\\n--Voyez-vous, ce cher abbé!\\n\\n--C'est un homme de précaution.\\n\\n--C'est un homme admirable, dit le Lucquois; et il vous les a envoyés?\\n\\n--Les voici.»\\n\\nLe Lucquois joignit les mains en signe d'admiration.\\n\\n«Vous avez épousé Olivia Corsinari dans l'église de Sainte-Paule de\\nMonte-Catini; voici le certificat du prêtre.\\n\\n--Oui, ma foi! le voilà, dit le major en le regardant avec étonnement.\\n\\n--Et voici l'acte de baptême d'Andrea Cavalcanti, délivré par le curé de\\nSaravezza.\\n\\n--Tout est en règle, dit le major.\\n\\n--Alors prenez ces papiers, dont je n'ai que faire, vous les donnerez à\\nvotre fils qui les gardera soigneusement.\\n\\n--Je le crois bien!... S'il les perdait....\\n\\n--Eh bien, s'il les perdait? demanda Monte-Cristo.\\n\\n--Eh bien, reprit le Lucquois, on serait obligé d'écrire là-bas, et ce\\nserait fort long de s'en procurer d'autres.\\n\\n--En effet, ce serait difficile, dit Monte-Cristo.\\n\\n--Presque impossible, répondit le Lucquois.\\n\\n--Je suis bien aise que vous compreniez la valeur de ces papiers.\\n\\n--C'est-à-dire que je les regarde comme impayables.\\n\\n--Maintenant, dit Monte-Cristo, quant à la mère du jeune homme?...\\n\\n--Quant à la mère du jeune homme... répéta le major avec inquiétude.\\n\\n--Quant à la marquise Corsinari?\\n\\n--Mon Dieu! dit le Lucquois, sous les pas duquel les difficultés\\nsemblaient naître, est-ce qu'on aurait besoin d'elle?\\n\\n--Non, monsieur, reprit Monte-Cristo; d'ailleurs, n'a-t-elle point?...\\n\\n--Si fait, si fait, dit le major, elle a....\\n\\n--Payé son tribut à la nature?...\\n\\n--Hélas! oui, dit vivement le Lucquois.\\n\\n--J'ai su cela, reprit Monte-Cristo; elle est morte il y a dix ans.\\n\\n--Et je pleure encore sa mort, monsieur, dit le major en tirant de sa\\npoche un mouchoir à carreaux et en s'essuyant alternativement d'abord\\nl'oeil gauche et ensuite l'oeil droit.\\n\\n--Que voulez-vous, dit Monte-Cristo, nous sommes tous mortels.\\nMaintenant vous comprenez, cher monsieur Cavalcanti, vous comprenez\\nqu'il est inutile qu'on sache en France que vous êtes séparé de votre\\nfils depuis quinze ans. Toutes ces histoires de Bohémiens qui enlèvent\\nles enfants n'ont pas de vogue chez nous. Vous l'avez envoyé faire son\\néducation dans un collège de province, et vous voulez qu'il achève cette\\néducation dans le monde parisien. Voilà pourquoi vous avez quitté\\nVia-Reggio, que vous habitiez depuis la mort de votre femme. Cela\\nsuffira.\\n\\n--Vous croyez?\\n\\n--Certainement.\\n\\n--Très bien, alors.\\n\\n--Si l'on apprenait quelque chose de cette séparation....\\n\\n--Ah! oui. Que dirais-je?\\n\\n--Qu'un précepteur infidèle, vendu aux ennemis de votre famille....\\n\\n--Aux Corsinari?\\n\\n--Certainement... avait enlevé cet enfant pour que votre nom s'éteignît.\\n\\n--C'est juste, puisqu'il est fils unique.\\n\\n--Eh bien, maintenant que tout est arrêté, que vos souvenirs, remis à\\nneuf, ne vous trahiront pas, vous avez deviné sans doute que je vous ai\\nménagé une surprise?\\n\\n--Agréable? demanda le Lucquois.\\n\\n--Ah! dit Monte-Cristo, je vois bien qu'on ne trompe pas plus l'oeil que\\nle coeur d'un père.\\n\\n--Hum! fit le major.\\n\\n--On vous a fait quelque révélation indiscrète, ou plutôt vous avez\\ndeviné qu'il était là.\\n\\n--Qui, là?\\n\\n--Votre enfant, votre fils, votre Andrea.\\n\\n--Je l'ai deviné, répondit le Lucquois avec le plus grand flegme du\\nmonde: ainsi il est ici?\\n\\n--Ici même, dit Monte-Cristo; en entrant tout à l'heure, le valet de\\nchambre m'a prévenu de son arrivée.\\n\\n--Ah! fort bien! ah! fort bien! dit le major en resserrant à chaque\\nexclamation les brandebourgs de sa polonaise.\\n\\n--Mon cher monsieur, dit Monte-Cristo, je comprends toute votre\\némotion, il faut vous donner le temps de vous remettre; je veux aussi\\npréparer le jeune homme à cette entrevue tant désirée, car je présume\\nqu'il n'est pas moins impatient que vous.\\n\\n--Je le crois, dit Cavalcanti.\\n\\n--Eh bien, dans un petit quart d'heure nous sommes à vous.\\n\\n--Vous me l'amenez donc? vous poussez donc la bonté jusqu'à me le\\nprésenter vous-même?\\n\\n--Non, je ne veux point me placer entre un père et son fils, vous serez\\nseuls, monsieur le major; mais soyez tranquille, au cas même où la voix\\ndu sang resterait muette, il n'y aurait pas à vous tromper: il entrera\\npar cette porte. C'est un beau jeune homme blond, un peu trop blond\\npeut-être, de manières toutes prévenantes; vous verrez.\\n\\n--À propos, dit le major, vous savez que je n'ai emporté avec moi que\\nles deux mille francs que ce bon abbé Busoni m'avait fait passer.\\nLà-dessus j'ai fait le voyage, et....\\n\\n--Et vous avez besoin d'argent... c'est trop juste, cher monsieur\\nCavalcanti. Tenez, voici pour faire un compte, huit billets de mille\\nfrancs.»\\n\\nLes yeux du major brillèrent comme des escarboucles.\\n\\n«C'est quarante mille francs que je vous redois, dit Monte-Cristo.\\n\\n--Votre Excellence veut-elle un reçu? dit le major en glissant les\\nbillets dans la poche intérieure de sa polonaise.\\n\\n--À quoi bon? dit le comte.\\n\\n--Mais pour vous décharger vis-à-vis de l'abbé Busoni.\\n\\n--Eh bien, vous me donnerez un reçu général en touchant les quarante\\nderniers mille francs. Entre honnêtes gens, de pareilles précautions\\nsont inutiles.\\n\\n--Ah! oui, c'est vrai, dit le major, entre honnêtes gens.\\n\\n--Maintenant, un dernier mot, marquis.\\n\\n--Dites.\\n\\n--Vous permettez une petite recommandation, n'est-ce pas?\\n\\n--Comment donc! Je la demande.\\n\\n--Il n'y aurait pas de mal que vous quittassiez cette polonaise.\\n\\n--Vraiment! dit le major en regardant le vêtement avec une certaine\\ncomplaisance.\\n\\n--Oui, cela se porte encore à Via-Reggio, mais à Paris il y a déjà\\nlongtemps que ce costume, quelque élégant qu'il soit, a passé de mode.\\n\\n--C'est fâcheux, dit le Lucquois.\\n\\n--Oh! si vous y tenez, vous le reprendrez en vous en allant.\\n\\n--Mais que mettrai-je?\\n\\n--Ce que vous trouverez dans vos malles.\\n\\n--Comment, dans mes malles! je n'ai qu'un portemanteau.\\n\\n--Avec vous sans doute. À quoi bon s'embarrasser? D'ailleurs, un vieux\\nsoldat aime à marcher en leste équipage.\\n\\n--Voilà justement pourquoi....\\n\\n--Mais vous êtes homme de précaution, et vous avez envoyé vos malles en\\navant. Elles sont arrivées hier à l'hôtel des Princes, rue Richelieu.\\nC'est là que vous avez retenu votre logement.\\n\\n--Alors dans ces malles?\\n\\n--Je présume que vous avez eu la précaution de faire enfermer par votre\\nvalet de chambre tout ce qu'il vous faut: habits de ville, habits\\nd'uniforme. Dans les grandes circonstances, vous mettrez l'habit\\nd'uniforme, cela fait bien. N'oubliez pas votre croix. On s'en moque\\nencore en France, mais on en porte toujours.\\n\\n--Très bien, très bien, très bien! dit le major qui marchait\\nd'éblouissements en éblouissements.\\n\\n--Et maintenant, dit Monte-Cristo, que votre coeur est affermi contre les\\némotions trop vives, préparez-vous, cher monsieur Cavalcanti, à revoir\\nvotre fils Andrea.»\\n\\nEt faisant un charmant salut au Lucquois, ravi, en extase, Monte-Cristo\\ndisparut derrière la tapisserie.\\n\\n\\nFIN DU TOME DEUXIÈME.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK LE COMTE DE MONTE-CRISTO, TOME II ***\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will\\nbe renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\\nroyalties.

It\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\n\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\\n\\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\n\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\nRevenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\nU.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.\\n\\nThe Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website\\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\n\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\n\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\\nvolunteer support.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\nedition.\\n\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\\n\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\"}"
